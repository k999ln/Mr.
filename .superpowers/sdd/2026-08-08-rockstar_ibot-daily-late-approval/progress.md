# SDD ledger — plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-08-rockstar_ibot-daily-late-approval.md

Setup: branch `feat/lm-daily-late-approval`, base `cdd1ad950`, baseline `59/59 PASS`.

Task 1: complete (`cdd1ad950..7f6cdca6a`; resolver 13/13 and related 39/39 PASS; fresh re-review SPEC PASS, QUALITY PASS, zero findings; pushed to `canonical/feat/lm-daily-late-approval`).

Task 2: complete (`7f6cdca6a..11f6cbc8d`; focused regression 48/48 PASS; isolated staging PostgreSQL role/RPC read-back complete; fresh re-review SPEC PASS, QUALITY PASS, zero findings; pushed to `canonical/feat/lm-daily-late-approval`).

Tasks 3–5 implementation checkpoint: commits through `0efe9c628`; focused late/Telegram/boundary suites passed, but fresh review returned three load-bearing findings. Tasks remain incomplete.

Fix round 1/5: two addressed, one open (`0efe9c628..83902ebe6`). Production-wide callback-only mail boundary and obsolete tick-time direct-send contract are addressed. Telegram accepted-but-timeout/DB-record-failure can still create a duplicate visible receipt.

Fix round 2/5: zero addressed, one open (`83902ebe6..d7353dce3`). Original-card edit prevents duplicate visible receipt, but idempotent Telegram `message is not modified` is treated as failure and callback IDs can override durable stored card IDs.

Fix round 3/5: one addressed, zero open (`d7353dce3..95dc14e5a`). Scoped re-review verdict ship; no new Critical/Important breakage.

Tasks 4–5: complete (`fb6974f18..95dc14e5a`, review clean after three bounded fix rounds).

Task 6: complete with concerns (`dcd9ad9ad..ac713cd8b`; Railway SUCCESS deployment `e284947e…` exact commit `dcd9ad9ad…`, existing controlled production receipt reconciled without replay; focused late suite 66/66, Telegram/onboard 33/33, diff check PASS; full `npm test` retains the known unrelated Connector legacy-path scanner failure 17/18). Pushed to `canonical/feat/lm-daily-late-approval`; no new third-party send was performed by recovery.
