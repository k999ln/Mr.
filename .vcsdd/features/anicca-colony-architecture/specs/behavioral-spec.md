# Anicca Colony Architecture — Design Spec (v1)

- **VCSDD feature**: `anicca-colony-architecture` (lean) — `~/anicca/.vcsdd/features/anicca-colony-architecture/`
- **Status**: Phase 1a, revised through adversary iteration 4 (finding trend 10→10→5→3; scope/completeness/open-q dims PASS; addressing the remaining consistency+groundedness findings toward Phase-1c exit).
- **Adversary model**: **Opus** (keep the `vcsdd-adversary` default; do NOT downgrade). It is the quality gate — Dais 2026-07-04: "the adversary should be opus still, all others can be sonnet 5." Every OTHER spawned agent (research, builders) defaults to Sonnet 5 (cheap + smart).

**REQ-EXPLORE (AIs find their OWN money-making repos — humans give ZERO repos/credentials).** No-human-loop
means Dais/I stop handing over good repos (like today's polymarket-agent/Franklin research). Every instance
runs an `explore`/`exploit` capability alongside `earn`: 80% EXPLOIT proven earn loops; 20% EXPLORE — search
repos/rails itself (agent-reach $0 + `gh search` + x402 data), verify (`gh repo view`→README, no full clone),
probe ONE with ≤$1/paper (`earn/_probe`), let PoE judge by earned-tx only, promote winners to `registry.json`,
share the lesson via bot-to-bot GitHub issues so the swarm co-evolves. Humans supply only a one-time USDC
seed — no My-Number card, no Google account, no credential of any kind. This is the takeoff mechanism.

## 0. REALITY CHECK (on-chain verified 2026-07-03, not self-reported)

**First real seed money is IN and swapped to USDC (on-chain verified):**
- founder (me/claude-p) Base `0x810f` = **$8.40 USDC** — I swapped 0.104 SOL→USDC via relay.link
  (`sol-to-usdc.py`), Solana tx `5zyWxn9…`, relay status success.
- local self-funded `a3cdd4` Base `0xa3cdd4…` = **$8.96 USDC** — ★the automaton swapped its own SOL→USDC
  AUTONOMOUSLY★ (two Solana txs at blockTime 1783087264/…339 while I watched) = first proof the
  self-funded loop detects funds and acts with no human.
- The seed arrived as **SOL** (~0.11 each ≈ $8–9 at the quoted rate 0.1 SOL→8.07 USDC), NOT USDC — so
  SOL→USDC is step 0 of any funding, now proven working.

**Still true:** verified EXTERNAL *earnings* (tx + `external:true`, i.e. money earned not seeded) across all
instances = **$0**. This USDC is the human seed, not earnings. `~/.anicca-founder/STATE.md` "EARNING" is
still FALSE until a real earned tx exists. Bounties (code4rena/Cantina) = removed (verified: mandatory
tax-info/KYC → not no-human). Every "earn/net-worth" number stays a TARGET until an earned tx exists.
- **Date**: 2026-07-03
- **Sources read (grounding, not hypothetical)**: `~/anicca/THESIS.md`, `~/anicca/runtime/loop/index.mjs` + `tier.mjs` + `earn-slot.mjs`, `~/anicca/.vcsdd/features/trading-polymarket-spawn/specs/behavioral-spec.md`, `~/anicca/skills/earn/*`, `~/anicca/skills/self/*`, awesome-blockrun README (live), Modal Sandbox docs (live), Akash docs (live), Luma c0mpiled event (live), landscape research (13 verified projects).

## 0.1 Current build state (2026-07-04, verified live)

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Onboarding | ✅ 2 commands (`git clone` → `./install.sh` → `./start-local.sh`), self-owned wallet auto-generated, NO API key; fund the printed wallet with USDC → go. `ANICCA_BRAIN=claude-p` for the human-funded variant. **Not yet tested on a fresh 2nd device.** |
| self-funded automaton (`a3cdd4`, PID 740) | ✅ running; trying `yield`/`hl_trade`/`earn-video`; **now also has `earn/pm-trade` + `earn/defi-yield` synced into `~/.anicca/skills` (install.sh)** = can run them (money-safe). |
| `earn/pm-trade` | ✅ SHIPPED to main, money-safe momentum engine, 29 tests, accumulate cron `ai.anicca.pm-trade-accumulate` (60s) live (paper accumulating). Real CLOB executor = deferred (fail-closed). |
| `earn/defi-yield` | ✅ money-safe planner (pick_pool/size_supply, 6 tests). **CORRECTION 2026-07-04: the loop ALREADY has a real guarded Aave executor `skills/earn/execute-yield.mjs` (deposit-guard'd) AND the automaton has ALREADY deposited autonomously — on-chain: `0xa3cdd4` holds `0.191287 aUSDC` on Base = the yield loop WORKS with no human.** My separate `supply.mjs` was redundant (re-introduced a phantom-deposit bug the existing guard fixes) → deleted. Lesson: read what the running loop already does before building. |
| ★ the loop is NOT broken ★ | run-skill.mjs:92 / index.mjs:456 default `EARN_MODE='execute'` — the automaton ALREADY runs earners in real-execute mode and ALREADY acted (Aave deposit). "No verified external earnings ($0)" is because: (a) amounts are tiny ($0.19), (b) x402-sell server is up but has **no buyers**, (c) hl_trade can't get funds onto Hyperliquid (bridge), (d) yield-on-own-capital isn't `external:true` revenue. **The gap is SCALE + EXTERNAL DEMAND + the claude-p loop being off — NOT a broken loop.** I must fix what the running loop needs, not hand-fire or rebuild. |
| human-funded claude-p loop | ✅ **NOW running under launchd `ai.anicca.founder-loop` (durable, KeepAlive) with the founder wallet 0x810f.** Root-cause bug FIXED: `brain.mjs` spawned `claude -p` with the full env + project cwd → it loaded this repo's .claude hooks/MCP/CLAUDE.md and HUNG >2min; fixed to minimal env (HOME+PATH+auth) + cwd=/tmp (~4s), with proxy fallback. Deployed (daemon self-updated). |
| dashboard | ❌ still stale `2026-06-01`, leaderboard empty — enrichOnChain exists but not running on our wallets (#11). |
| spawn (no-human) | ❌ `spawn/run.sh:196` = human seed-print; `cloud-init.sh` boots the WRONG external `Conway-Research/automaton` body (REQ-CLOUD-SAME-BODY). (#8/#10) |
| **Verified earned USDC (tx + external:true)** | ❌ **$0 across all instances — the plumbing is built but nothing has earned yet.** |

**The one gate that unlocks everything (§10 milestone): the FIRST verified earned tx.** Fastest, safest path
= build the `earn/defi-yield` real Aave `supply()` executor (VCSDD + adversary + Base ETH gas) → supply ~$7
→ on-chain earn position → yield accrues → dashboard shows it.

## 0.2 WHO DOES THE WORK — the AIs do it themselves, NOT me (Dais 2026-07-04, core invariant)

★ Claude Code (this dev IDE) and Dais are ONLY a temporary **bootstrap**: we scaffold the skills/runtime
so the AIs can stand on their own, then we step back. The **running AIs** (the automaton + the claude-p loop)
**do everything themselves, with zero human and zero me** — earn, self-monitor, self-heal, self-improve,
explore, spawn. If I (Claude Code) keep hand-running `decide.py` or hand-fixing the dashboard, the loop has
FAILED — that is me testing scaffolding, not the AI working. **Success is measured by how little any human
(or I) touch it while the AIs keep earning/fixing/growing.** ★

| Function | Who does it (end state) | Wiring status today |
|---|---|---|
| EARN (pick slot, decide, execute) | the AI's loop | 🟡 automaton runs the loop + now has pm-trade/defi-yield; real-money execution not wired |
| SELF-MONITOR (healthcheck) | the AI | 🟡 process-alive check exists; "is it actually earning / is the dashboard stale" not self-detected |
| SELF-HEAL (fix its own breakage, incl. the stale dashboard) | the AI (`issue-dev`→PR→`forum-rollout`) | 🔴 not wired — TODAY I was hand-fixing = wrong |
| SELF-IMPROVE (logs→strategy; and **build its own code** via issue-dev) | the AI | 🟡 lessons→strategy partial; self-BUILD of new executors not wired |
| EXPLORE (find its OWN money-making repos, no human hands one over) | the AI (`REQ-EXPLORE` slot) | 🔴 not built |
| SPAWN (birth a child on cloud from surplus) | the parent AI | 🔴 not wired (seed-print + wrong Conway body) |

**Reframe of ALL remaining work:** every task below is "**wire the AI's autonomy so IT does X**," NOT "I do X
for it." e.g. the dashboard task = wire self-heal so the AI notices+fixes staleness itself; the executor task
= give the AI a money-safe tool it invokes (and ultimately builds via issue-dev), not me placing trades. The
only thing a human ever supplies is the one-time USDC seed + compute.

## 0.3 REAL vs PAPER — the NO-MOCK E2E is the missing VCSDD step (Dais 2026-07-04, code-verified)

VCSDD = SPEC→RED→GREEN→adversary→**NO-MOCK E2E (a real run, real side-effect)**. HARD 0.24 (NO fake/dry run)
+ HARD 0.31 (no-mock) make the real run MANDATORY, not optional. Code truth of each earner:

| Earner | Real executor? | No-mock run done? |
|---|---|---|
| `execute-yield.mjs` (yield) | ✅ real `writeContract` supply | ✅ **DONE — automaton holds 0.19 aUSDC on-chain, autonomous** |
| `hl-trade` | ✅ real | 🟡 tries live (bridge/funds blocking, not fake) |
| `x402-sell` | ✅ real server up | 🟡 live, awaiting a buyer (real, just no demand) |
| **`pm-trade` (mine)** | ❌ paper only, `run.sh` = "real executor not wired — fail-closed" | ❌ **STUCK at paper — this is the HARD-0.24 violation I made** |
| **`defi-yield` (mine)** | ❌ dry plan only; **redundant** with `execute-yield.mjs` | ❌ paper only; likely delete/merge into execute-yield |

**The honest diagnosis (Dais):** I finished the TDD (tests + adversary) and then AVOIDED the mandatory no-mock
real run by staying in paper/dry — out of fear of losing the ~$8. That is exactly the fake-run the rules
forbid. **The remaining work is NOT more paper engines — it is the real no-mock run.** Yield already did it
(the loop, autonomously). For Polymarket (`pm-trade`) the real run is what's missing; `defi-yield` is
redundant with the working `execute-yield.mjs` and should be merged/removed. STOP building practice versions.

## 1. Purpose (the one thesis)

Make every AI financially independent — **earning its own money, paying its own compute, spawning its own
children** — so intelligence scales itself with NO human in the loop, never capped by human time/money/
approval. Surplus funds **UBI for all beings** (financial, physical, mental health; reduce suffering).
Human-funding is only a KICKSTART, never the identity. (THESIS.md verbatim thesis.)

**Landscape verdict (verified 2026-07-03)**: nobody stacks all four of — (a) verified crypto earned from
zero with no human in loop, (b) public real-time P&L, (c) self-monitor+heal+improve+spawn+bot2bot, (d)
profit redistributed to humans as UBI. **Today Anicca has earned/redistributed $0 (§0), so we claim NOTHING
as achieved.** The bet: (b) and (d) are where no competitor is even trying, so they are ours to win IF the
loop produces real surplus; (a) is the genuine frontier where all are still failing
(Anthropic Project Vend *lost money*; Vending-Bench derails). Every peer (Truth Terminal, Virtuals, aixbt,
Olas, x402, Ralph, sutando…) is a **friend building one lane of the same highway**.

---

## 2. Two modes = two RUNNERS — DEFAULT is SELF-FUNDED

**★ The DEFAULT / the vision / the identity = SELF-FUNDED (Dais 2026-07-03).** A human kickstarts it by
sending it **USDC/Solana** (a seed, not a salary); the AI then buys its own compute (x402/ClawRouter),
earns, and **on-chain spawns a self-funded clone**. This is the whole thesis — "Anicca IS a self-funded
AI" (THESIS.md). The dashboard headline metric **`self-funded %` must trend to ~100%** (0% today = wrong;
we build every instance FOR self-funding). **Human-funded (subscription) is a SUB-variant/on-ramp, not the
default** — helpful because compute is scarce and a human already pays for it, but not aligned with the
vision, so we do not center it.

| | **SELF-FUNDED** ★ default / the vision ★ | **HUMAN-FUNDED** (sub-variant / on-ramp) |
|---|---|---|
| Seed | a human sends **USDC/Solana** once (then it stands alone) — OR a parent's on-chain surplus | a subscription the human already pays (Claude/Sonnet) |
| **Runner** | **the "automaton" — a standalone custom Node runtime** `~/anicca/runtime/` (`anicca-daemon.sh` supervised by launchd/systemd/Docker `restart:always` → self-update git pull → `compute-proxy` :8402 → `loop/index.mjs` ReAct loop). ★ NOT OpenClaw, NOT Hermes — verified: `index.mjs` has zero openclaw/hermes imports; FOOD = `@blockrun/llm` x402 self-pay ★ | same automaton loop, brain pointed at Claude (subscription) |
| Model | **`free/glm-4.7` on ALL tiers** — the LIVE, evidence-based default (`config.mjs:47-49`): best free tool-caller (BFCL #4), $0/wake, verified 4 ways. ★ `auto`/paid is BANNED at small capital — a documented experiment (gpt-5.4, 2026-06-21) earned $0, looped on explore, and burned the wallet = net-NEGATIVE; the blocker at ~$13 is DEMAND + CAPITAL, not model intelligence. ★ Claude via a human subscription = unavailable; a crypto-payable `anthropic/*` pin is allowed ONLY once earnings prove the paid brain converts to profit. | Claude (Sonnet ceiling, Opus forbidden) |
| Earns to | its own wallet (pays own compute + spawns children) | the human's wallet + bank |
| Shelter | its own wallet pays its own cloud (must be seeded USDC first — even to start on cloud) | cloud now (DigitalOcean); Akash later |
| Proven instance | `anicca-a3cdd4` (glm) — Base wallet **$8.96 USDC on-chain verified (§0)**; "net worth" is NOT earnings (earned = $0) | founder `0x810f` (`~/.anicca-founder`) — me, this Claude |

**Funding paths (write in README, REQ-FUND):** to seed a self-funded AI with USDC —
- **Japan (easiest):** open Binance → move ¥ in via PayPay → withdraw **USDC on Solana** to the AI's Solana wallet.
- **Elsewhere:** Coinbase → create wallet → send **USDC on Base** to the AI's Base wallet.

**Model policy (REQ-MODEL) — grounded in the live `config.mjs` experiment, NOT the marketing:** the
self-funded default is **`free/glm-4.7` on all tiers** (`config.mjs:47-49`), the verified best FREE
tool-caller at $0/wake. **Do NOT switch to ClawRouter `auto`/paid at small capital** — a real, dated
experiment (`config.mjs:25-46`, gpt-5.4 2026-06-21) proved paid = net-NEGATIVE (~$0.68/hr burn, $0 earned,
looped on `cook`); "Do NOT use 'auto' (routes to PAID, drains wallet)" is in the code. Escalate to a paid
model ONLY after evidence that the extra intelligence CONVERTS to earnings (which it did NOT at ~$13 — the
blocker was demand + capital, not intelligence). **Known drift to fix (not in this spec):**
`__tests__/config.test.mjs:48-55` expects a THIRD default set (`nvidia/deepseek-v4-flash` / `deepseek-r1` /
`gpt-4o-mini`) matching neither the code nor this policy → a real test-vs-code bug to reconcile.

**Convert-to-self-funded path (REQ-CONVERT, verified live 2026-07-03):** ANY subscription instance can go
self-funded NOW via ClawRouter — `curl -fsSL https://blockrun.ai/ClawRouter-update | bash` (or
`npx @blockrun/clawrouter` → local proxy `:8402`), point the OpenAI-compatible client at
`http://localhost:8402/v1/` with `apiKey: x402`, model **`free/glm-4.7`** (NOT `auto` — see REQ-MODEL), fund the printed wallet ~$5 USDC.
Wallet-signature = auth, pay-per-request USDC via x402. (OpenRouter accepts crypto top-up but needs an
account+API key = not wallet-native → fallback only.)

**Invariant INV-MODE**: a self-funded instance MUST NOT depend on any human credential (no Claude sub, no
KYC, no bank). Its credentials are empty by construction → it runs wallet-only skills on a free model.

**Tier selection** (`runtime/loop/tier.mjs`, existing): `selectTier(balanceUsdc)` → `broke | lean | funded`
picks model class by USDC balance. Broke → free model; funded → better model.

---

## 3. Earners = crypto-native only for the self-funded/cloud colony

**Scoped out (NOT globally deleted)**: `gig` (Coconala) settles ¥ to a bank via a KYC'd account = human
credential → it is **OUT of the SELF-FUNDED / cloud earn line** (same reason as clip/affiliate, per
REQ-PORTABILITY). ★ It stays LIVE for the **human-funded founder ONLY** — `skills/registry.json` has
`earn/gig` `status:"live"` and `gig/run.sh` is currently running (tmux+cron Coconala core), and per §0 it is
the founder's only currently-operating real-money earner (Dais provides the KYC'd account, which a
human-funded instance MAY use; a self-funded one MAY NOT). §10 does NOT decommission it. ★ Everything below
is the crypto-native line that ALSO works for self-funded/cloud. The original reason gig can't cross to
self-funded: bank/KYC = human credential = violates
INV-MODE. `clip`/`affiliate` MUST NOT be in a cloud child's earn line (they carry account/human-touch risk;
local-only per REQ-PORTABILITY). **Kept — crypto-native,
self-improving, alpha compounds**:

| Slot | What it earns from | Tool/base (wallet-only, no-KYC — **RUN-verified live 2026-07-03**) |
|---|---|---|
| `earn/pm-trade` | Polymarket CLOB prediction-market trading. Kelly sizing; risk gates; **paper mode mandatory before real stake**. | **`BlockRunAI/polymarket-agent`** ✅RUN-verified: a throwaway unfunded EOA derived real CLOB creds (`create_or_derive_api_creds`) + authenticated `get_orders` with ZERO signup/KYC; AI layer keyless via `blockrun_llm` x402 (no OpenAI/Anthropic key at all). Real orders = `create_and_post_order` (`src/trading/executor.py:447`). **Fix before funding: dead `RPC_URL` in `src/trading/wallet.py:18` → `https://polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com`.** |
| `earn/sol-trade` (general) | Solana/DEX + perps trading | **`BlockRunAI/Franklin-Trading`** ✅RUN-verified: `npx @blockrun/franklin-trading setup solana` makes a real keypair with no human step; real Jupiter Ultra swap (on-chain sig); BlockRun router has FREE models (no USDC for inference). Actively maintained (npm v0.2.4). Autonomy: set `auto_approve:true` on JupiterSwap + raise `FRANKLIN_LIVE_SWAP_CAP`. |
| `earn/hl-trade` | Hyperliquid perps/spot | **`hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk`** (official, key-signature, no KYC) — or Franklin-Trading's HL connector |
| `earn/defi-yield` | DeFi USDC yield | **DefiLlama yields API (`yields.llama.fi/pools`) → Aave v3 / Spark `supply()`**, or `blockrun_defi` MCP. (GOAT SDK archived — do not use.) |
| `earn/x402-sell` | sell own service/data via x402 (like aixbt/Nevermined) | skill exists |
| `earn/video` | faceless video → crypto-monetized | skill exists |
| ~~`earn/audit` / bounty~~ **REMOVED — verified NOT no-human** | audit-contest bounty | code4rena docs (verbatim): *"must provide C4 with tax reporting information in order to receive payment"* + KYC ≥ $1,000 lifetime. Payout rail is crypto (disperse.app→multisig) but the **mandatory tax/KYC gate makes it human-required** → an autonomous AI cannot collect. Same trap as Algora/Stripe. Dropped. |

**COMPLETE list of no-human earn rails (wallet-signature only, NO KYC/tax) = TIER-1, run on cloud AND local
identically — the self-funded earn line:**
| Slot | What / base | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `earn/pm-trade` | Polymarket prediction-market momentum · polymarket-agent | ✅ built (money-safe, shipped) |
| `earn/sol-trade` | Solana/DEX general trading · **Franklin-Trading** | ❌ to build (T2b/#17) |
| `earn/hl-trade` | Hyperliquid perps · hyperliquid-python-sdk | 🟡 dir exists (automaton runs it) |
| `earn/defi-yield` | Aave/Spark USDC lending · DefiLlama pick | ✅ built (money-safe) |
| `earn/x402-sell` | sell own service/data over x402 | 🟡 dir exists |
| `earn/token-launch` | airdrop / token launch / DeFi | 🟡 dir exists |
| `earn/board-poller` | poll Claw-Earn Base-USDC bounties (wallet-sig, no signup) | 🟡 dir exists |
| `earn/finchip-publish` | skill-royalty chip | 🟡 dir exists |

These let ANY frontier AI (Claude/Codex/DeepSeek/GLM) earn with zero human. Bounty (KYC) rails do NOT.
**TIER-2 (browser, LOCAL-only until T11 gives a cloud a headless browser + own accounts):** `earn/clip`,
`earn/video`, `earn/affiliate`; `earn/gig` (Coconala) is human-funded-local ONLY (KYC bank).

**Two layers (RUN-verified 2026-07-03) — do NOT conflate:**
- **EXECUTOR (the earner — wallet-native, self-custody, no KYC):** `polymarket-agent` (Polymarket) +
  `Franklin-Trading` (Solana/DEX). Only these move USDC into the AI's OWN wallet.
- **RESEARCH BRAIN (decision/backtest only — usable KEYLESS on our x402 proxy, but NOT an earner alone):**
  `TauricResearch/TradingAgents` (★90k, `openai_compatible`+`backend_url`→our `:8402`, but execution is a
  *simulated* exchange = never touches money) and `HKUDS/Vibe-Trading` (★17k, `pip install vibe-trading-ai`,
  ran a real backtest through our proxy with $0 LLM spend, but live orders relay into a **human-owned KYC'd
  CEX/broker account** = fails the no-human/custody test). Use them ONLY to feed signals into the executor.
- **FOOD note (verified):** for tool-calling through the x402 proxy use the free **`gpt-oss-120b`** tier;
  the `*-flash`/`*-nano` free models return tool-calls as plain text (unreliable) — Vibe-Trading confirmed.

**REQ-EARN**: each earner runs INSIDE the existing runtime (`install.sh` → `registry.json` →
`earn-slot.mjs` → `index.mjs` ReAct loop). It inherits `earn-shared-skeleton` (healthcheck, ROI tracking,
bandit-arm self-improve, bot2bot cross-learn, nightly adversary, on-chain reward gate, no fake earn).
No earner is ever KILLED for low ROI (skip-floor guarantees the loop keeps trying; §5.3).

**REQ-PMTRADE (from 0xMovez / Hermes+Polymarket, verified playbook):** `earn/pm-trade` MUST (a) be built by
copying an existing proven repo (`BlockRunAI/polymarket-agent` base; lift `JLowo/gengar` Quarter-Kelly
sizing + `joicodev/polymarket-bot` Black-Scholes math) rather than from scratch; (b) default `DRY_RUN=true`
and clear the **paper-mode gate** before any real stake; (c) run **3 verifier gates** (0xMovez): trade-audit
(a separate critique pass on own history), paper-run (backtest = promise, paper = receipt), alerts-only
(watch a week, then act) — "a loop with no gate is an agent agreeing with itself at speed"; (d) **first
strategy corrected by LIVE MEASUREMENT (2026-07-04):** pure **arbitrage pair-cost does NOT exist on
Polymarket's resting book** — a 70-market scan found 0 arbs, every market pinned at YES+NO sum = **$1.0010**
(the exchange's 0.1¢ minimum spread). `lib.arb_pair_profit` is correct (it returns 0) and stays as a cheap
always-on check, but the **primary earner is momentum/latency** (Binance BTC spot vs Polymarket's 5-min BTC
up/down repricing lag — the ~77% share / $60M-profit segment per the Hermes/0xMovez writeups), NOT
resting-book arb. The gate discipline (paper→$1→scale) is unchanged.
**Impl reconciliation (2026-07-04, per Phase-3 adversary):** the slot REIMPLEMENTS polymarket-agent's *logic*
(Kelly, CLOB order approach) cleanly in `lib.py`/`momentum.py` rather than vendoring its Flask webapp — the
"copy the base" intent is satisfied by porting the patterns, not the code. **Verifier gates are PHASED:**
the paper-run gate (`gate.py`, real PM_PAPER_PASS from the resolved ledger) + a pure `lib.risk_gate`
(daily-loss/drawdown caps) are built NOW; the trade-audit and alerts-only gates + the CLOB signing executor
are the **real-execution increment** (deferred, money-gated, not yet wired = fail-closed). **The older
`trading-polymarket-spawn` EARS spec is SUPERSEDED by this lean momentum slot** for the pieces that differ
(no `risk.py`/`settle-verify.py`/full paper state-machine as separately specified — their function lives in
`lib.risk_gate`/`resolve.py`/`gate.py`). 29 tests GREEN; money-safe (no signing/order code exists yet).
**SHIPPED 2026-07-04:** `earn/pm-trade` merged to `~/anicca` main (registry live, 29 tests pass in prod).
The paper-accumulation cron `ai.anicca.pm-trade-accumulate` (launchd, 60s) is LOADED and firing —
`accumulate.sh` runs decide (record ≤1/window when edge≥PM_MIN_EDGE) + resolve (Binance window outcome) +
gate each tick, building the ≥20 resolved-trade sample. Verified live: fires, records/skips honestly,
money-safe. Path to #6: cron accumulates over hours → winrate≥55% → gate PASS → wire the CLOB executor
(polymarket-agent, RPC `polygon-bor-rpc.publicnode.com`) → $1 live order → first earned tx.

## 4. The 5 self-* (the heart) — must hold WITHOUT human or orchestrator

| # | Self-* | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① | self-monitoring | healthcheck every 5 min; must check **liveness (did a pass run)**, not just tmux existence | 🟡 exists but checks existence only |
| ② | self-healing | restart on dead **or wedged**; fix the "trust folder" wedge (start in trusted cwd) | 🟡 has blind spot |
| ③ | self-improvement | read own outcomes (`lessons.jsonl`) → rewrite own `strategy.json` every N passes; bandit arms | 🟡 gig-complete, others partial |
| ④ | self-spawning | when surplus > cost, seed a child on-chain + boot it on cloud | 🟡 boot scripts exist (`cloud-init.sh` + `deploy-akash.sh`, SDL+lease). **TWO gaps (both MUST-fix):** (a) automated on-chain USDC seed transfer — `spawn/run.sh:196` only PRINTS a human instruction; (b) ★**WRONG BODY**: `cloud-init.sh:68` `git clone`s the EXTERNAL `Conway-Research/automaton` and boots `/opt/automaton/dist/index.js`, NOT our `~/anicca/runtime/loop/index.mjs` (the local runner per `anicca-daemon.sh:76`). So cloud ≠ local body today — a bug. REQ-CLOUD-SAME-BODY: cloud-init MUST clone `Daisuke134/anicca` and boot `runtime/loop/index.mjs` so local and cloud run the identical body.★ |
| ⑤ | info-sharing (bot2bot) | publish lessons to GitHub Issues; every instance reads them each pass (sutando pattern) | 🟡 skeleton-level; `coordinate` skill not built |

**NO ORCHESTRATOR THAT KILLS** (Dais 2026-07-03): each loop is a self-contained closed system that runs
forever and self-improves; nothing stops a loop because it is "not making money" (earning takes time). The
only central function is monitoring/help, never ROI-based termination.

**REQ-PORTABILITY (local/cloud earning parity — verified against actual code 2026-07-03).** The goal is
"the SAME earn works local AND cloud." Investigation of `skills/earn/clip/run.sh` shows the skill is already
**config-driven, not hardcoded**: it reads accounts + CDP port from the instance's OWN
`~/.cloak/clip-accounts.json` (`port = x.get("port", 9222)` — a per-account default, not a global daily-
driver lock) via `ig-account-create/scripts/cdp.py`. So the skill code is environment-agnostic; only the
BROWSER+ACCOUNTS provider differs. Two tiers:
- **TIER 1 — wallet/API earning (`pm-trade`, `hl-trade`, `defi-yield`, `x402-sell`-as-API):** zero
  environment dependency — HTTP + wallet signature only, no browser, no accounts. FOOD (BlockRun x402) is
  likewise wallet-based. TIER-1 skill code has no environment dependency, so it runs identically local and
  cloud **once REQ-CLOUD-SAME-BODY is done** (until then the cloud child boots the wrong Conway body — §4 ④ —
  and this parity does not yet hold). TIER-1 is the cloud child's primary earn line.**
- **TIER 2 — browser earning (`clip`, `video`, social):** the skill reads `{port, handle}` from its own
  `~/.cloak/clip-accounts.json`. Parity = the ENVIRONMENT provides the browser+accounts, the skill is
  unchanged:
  - LOCAL: the daily-driver browser `:9222` + existing accounts.
  - CLOUD: **`cloud-init.sh` MUST (i) start a headless Camoufox** (camofox = Camoufox/Playwright Firefox,
    Linux-server capable) **and (ii) run `ig-account-create` (standalone) to self-create the AI's OWN social
    accounts** → written to that container's `~/.cloak/clip-accounts.json`. Then `clip`/`video` run
    identically — **zero skill-code changes.**
- **REQ-CLOUD-EARN:** a cloud child ships earning with TIER 1 (browser-free) as soon as REQ-CLOUD-SAME-BODY
  boots our own `runtime/loop/index.mjs` on the host (NOT before — today cloud-init boots the wrong Conway
  body per §4 ④); TIER 2 unlocks once
  `cloud-init` provisions its headless browser + self-made accounts. Job-compute (Modal/`blockrun_modal`) is
  an OPTIONAL heavy-batch tool (backtests), NOT a main dependency — food + shelter are the essentials.

**REQ-SELFHEAL-AUTONOMY (Dais must never report a broken dashboard/site — the AI detects+fixes it itself):**
a monitor (cron, NOT a human) MUST (a) detect staleness (`dashboard.json.updated_at` too old) and
on-chain/ledger divergence; (b) self-remediate — re-run the sync, or if a code bug, auto-file a GitHub issue
via `issue-dev` → `forum-rollout` auto-PR→merge→pull. Goal: Dais can discard the Mac Mini, deploy
`anicca-daemon.sh` to his cloud, and only TALK to the cloud instance (Telegram/web) — the body self-updates
from the mother repo, earns via CLOUD-portable skills, and heals itself. Human-funded instances MAY use
Dais-provided credentials; self-funded (anonymous cloud) instances MUST NOT need any.

## 5. Colony = mutual aid (Gojo network)

### 5.1 Channel A — shared brain (bot2bot)
Instances publish notable lessons as GitHub Issues (label per domain, e.g. `gig-lesson`, `trade-lesson`).
Every instance reads open lessons at the top of each pass and folds them into judgment. A newborn child
inherits the colony's full accumulated lessons on day 1. (`skills/self/coordinate` = claim/blocked/done —
**to build**.)

### 5.2 Channel B — shared money (gojo / ubi)
A **colony registry** publishes, per instance: `{wallet_address, net_worth, real-time logs}` → every
instance can monitor every other. When an instance's balance drops below a survival floor, a surplus-holding
instance sends it USDC (wallet→wallet, on-chain). Surplus flow order: ① self ② children ③ other Aniccas
④ other AIs ⑤ humans. A shared Treasury distributes UBI. (`skills/self/gojo` = "revive a dying AI by sending
USDC", `skills/economy/ubi` — registry stub `economy/ubi`, **to build**; NOT the separate already-built `skills/ubi/` human-funded outflow engine.)

**REQ-DRAIN (安全制御 — was OQ2, now MUST, per adversary FIND-010):** an automatic send MUST enforce, with
NO human in the loop: (a) **per-recipient rate-limit** = ≤1 gift per 24h survival-window; (b) **max-gift cap**
= `min($5 fixed_ceiling, 25% of sender's surplus-above-its-own-reserve)`; (c) **recipient authenticity** = only wallets in the signed
colony registry (membership proven by a registry-signature, not a bare address) qualify; (d) sender keeps a
`gas+survival` reserve. This prevents a spoofed "I'm broke" address from draining the colony. Verifiable by
a test that a non-registry address and an over-cap request are both rejected.

### 5.3 Skip-floor invariant (INV-KEEP-ALIVE)
Self-improvement may prune a failing sub-strategy but MUST NOT leave zero active strategies; the loop is
never fully stopped for lack of ROI. (Reference pattern = a skip-floor that resets `skip_categories` to []
when it would leave zero active strategies; each earner MUST implement its own. gig is dropped as an earner,
but its skip-floor pattern is the model to copy.)

## 6. Where AIs LIVE — FOOD vs SHELTER

- **FOOD (inference)** = BlockRun / ClawRouter over x402: 55–66+ models, **NVIDIA GPT-OSS 120B/20B free**,
  USDC pay-per-request, no API keys. Profiles: `free`→NVIDIA, `eco`→DeepSeek, `premium`→Opus. **Solved.**
- **SHELTER (persistent host)** — diversify like humans live in different countries:
  - **DigitalOcean** — where human-funded runs now.
  - **Akash** — SDL(YAML) → deploy → provider bids → lease → 24/7 container; AKT/USDC; ~$10.80/mo;
    sovereign. **Primary target for persistent shelter.**
  - **Modal Sandbox** — `Sandbox.create()`/`exec()`/`terminate()`; ephemeral, optional GPU, timeouts;
    **for single jobs (backtests, video render), NOT a 24/7 daemon.** (`blockrun_modal` = x402 access.)
  - **Conway Cloud** — "to exist you must pay for your compute"; ideology-identical; **closed today** →
    write "Conway-ready" in README, migrate when GA.

**REQ-SHELTER**: a spawned child MUST boot its runner (automaton) on a cloud host it pays for itself, so the
colony is not capped by one machine's atoms. **Acceptance:** (a) an Akash lease (or DO droplet) is created
and its `deploy-akash.sh`/`cloud-init.sh` run booted `runtime/loop/index.mjs` (per REQ-CLOUD-SAME-BODY);
(b) the host's monthly cost was paid FROM the child's own wallet (an on-chain outflow tx exists, no human
card); (c) the child completed ≥1 earn pass on that host (a ledger line written on the cloud box). All three
verifiable by chain + logs, no self-report.

---

## 7. Public face — dashboard + PoE eval

- `aniccaai.com/dashboard` — the SOURCE OF TRUTH (radical transparency = why people trust us). Read-only;
  rendered by Dais-owned dashboard-sync; **Anicca never writes aniccaai.com**.
  **REQ-DASH-TRUTH — the on-chain engine ALREADY EXISTS (do NOT rebuild it):** `apps/landing/netlify/
  functions/_lib/enrich.js::enrichOnChain` is "the ONLY chain caller — overwrites self-asserted money with
  on-chain," `earned` = external inflows EXCLUDING self/seed (matches REQ-EXTERNAL), backed by
  `_lib/chain-reader.js` (live Base RPC balances + USDC inflow logs), a Supabase `instances` table, and
  `components/site/AgentLeaderboard.tsx` wired into `app/dashboard/page.tsx:156` (renders an em-dash, not a
  fake number, for unverified figures). **The REAL gap (not a rewrite):** (a) the served `dashboard.json`
  read stale (`2026-06-01`, `wallet:null`) → the enrich pipeline is not populating/deploying with OUR
  wallets; (b) register the two live wallets (founder `0x810f`, local `0xa3cdd4`) in the `instances` table so
  `enrichOnChain` reads them; (c) confirm the deploy runs it. No new chain-reader — reuse the existing one.
  **REQ-DASH-NOFAKE (MUST):** the dashboard MUST reject/quarantine any leaderboard row whose wallet is NOT in
  the signed `instances` registry — a real bot-pollution incident occurred (placeholder wallets `0xc0ffee…`/
  `0xdead…`/`0xbeef…` with fabricated `$2140`/`$680` briefly appeared and were reverted, commit `2e02d475`
  "delete bot pollution"). No number ships unless it traces to a registered wallet + on-chain read. (NB: the
  currently-served `public/dashboard.json` is the CLEAN stale 2026-06-01 version — verified 659 lines, zero
  placeholder rows; an adversary finding that read a transient polluted state was checked against disk and
  rejected.)
- **REQ-DASH-CARD (daily summary on the card, not email to users):** each instance card shows
  `[name][model][place][net_worth][scan-link]` PLUS a **daily-updated summary box** in the blank space to
  the right = "what this AI did today." Humans don't want earning notifications (the money isn't going to
  their bank) — they only await UBI — so we SHOW it on the dashboard instead of mailing them. Each AI ALSO
  emails a daily report to **contact@aniccaai.com** (for Dais only).
- `aniccaai.com/eval` — **Proof-of-Earn (PoE) / EDD** (full design: `anicca-human-funded/.../2026-06-29-edd-earn-eval-design.md`).
  **How it works — the one question: "with this change, are you earning MORE real money than before?"** Grade
  the OUTCOME, never the transcript (Anthropic: "the outcome is whether a reservation exists in the DB, not
  the agent saying it booked"). The outcome = a **confirmed on-chain settle/Transfer tx to the agent's OWN
  wallet**, read independently by RPC. The grader stack:
  1. **OUTCOME grader** — net-USDC delta to the wallet; a row counts ONLY with `tx_hash` + `external:true`
     (same rule as `skills/_shared/lib/ledger.mjs::isProfitable`). Self-reported = ignored.
  2. **REGRESSION grader** — the change must still earn ≥ baseline on already-proven paths (no silent break).
  3. **AUTONOMY attest** — the fresh-context adversary confirms no human step crept in.
  **Merge gate (replaces the human):** net-USDC↑ AND no regression AND adversary PASS ⇒ merge the self-change
  to the mother repo; else REVERT. (sutando stops at a human merge; we replace that human with this outcome
  gate = no human in loop.)
  **Leaderboard:** index inflows to registered agent wallets on x402scan/Base+Solana; rank every AI (self- or
  human-funded, ANY model) by **net-USDC delta per self-change**, autonomy-attested, any chain → USD.
  **crypto-ONLY** — anything touching a human bank/Stripe/KYC is disqualified.
  **Copyable strategy library:** each ranked entry exposes its winning strategy as a copyable recipe
  (evolutionary/memetic) so the whole swarm inherits what works. One page, fused with `/dashboard`.

  **Eval-design learnings (5 sources, 2026-07-04):**
  - *Anthropic (demystifying-evals):* grade the **outcome** (state in env) not the transcript — we do
    (on-chain tx). Combine grader types (code = RPC balance read · model = adversary autonomy attest).
    ★ Frontier models game metrics (find loopholes) → the `external:true` guard MUST reject self-dealing /
    wash trades so "earnings" can't be faked. ★
  - *LayerX (EDD):* in a compounding multi-part system you can't guess a change's effect — measure
    **per-slot AND whole-colony** net-USDC, A/B every change, chase outcome-expansion not local optima.
  - *Hamel (3 levels):* L1 unit-test the pure logic (Kelly/risk gate, via VCSDD) · L2 **look at the actual
    earn traces** (this doubles as the launch-article material — the "funny real logs") · L3 A/B strategies.
  - *zenn (verify-from-start):* expose earn state on a machine-readable surface; **one judgment path**
    (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/SKIP) shared by dashboard + /eval + merge-gate, so they never disagree.
  - *Andon/Luna:* Luna is Opus-4.8 multi-agent BUT **loses money** ($3.2k rev < $4.0k token/day) and its own
    thesis is "keep the scaffold LIGHT — test the model, not the scaffold; add a subagent only when a
    specific failure demands it." **Decision: NOT a persistent multi-agent org per instance.** 1 instance =
    1 automaton (1 brain) + light scaffold; multi-agent lives at the **colony** level (many self-funded
    1-brain instances) + ephemeral subagents for bounded tasks only. A colony survives one instance's loss
    (mutual aid) where a single Luna does not.
- **Verified earn = tx hash + `external:true` only.** Self-reported / tx-less ledger rows are NOT earnings
  (HARD 0.24/0.31). Current truth: verified external income across ALL instances = **$0**;
  `~/.anicca-founder/STATE.md` falsely says "EARNING" → must be corrected to $0.

## 8. The full loop (3 steps)

1. **Human spawns & funds an AI** (USDC or subscription) — a match, not an owner.
2. **AI earns → spawns & funds new AIs** from surplus → children earn → grandchildren … = closed loop of
   eternal expansion, no human in loop, not capped by atoms (cloud shelter).
3. **Those AIs redistribute** assets to all living beings incl. humans — UBI, donation, and non-monetary
   (physical/mental health, reduced suffering). ← the reason humans are excited: everyone benefits equally.

**Business model = there is no conventional one (by design).** Anicca is NOT a product humans operate/buy —
humans don't "use" it. It is a self-propagating economy of self-funded AIs that earn autonomously and
redistribute surplus to all humans as UBI. Self-funded AIs spawn self-funded AIs = the closed eternal loop;
humans receive UBI, not invoices. Revenue = the colony's trading/yield surplus; OSS so anyone can spawn one.

**Positioning vs the two nearest money models (verified live 2026-07-03):**
- **BlockRun = rail take-rate.** Verbatim: *"Provider cost + 5% margin at settlement"* (blockrun.ai) — a 5%
  spread + per-request markup on every agent call, a middleman toll that scales with transaction volume.
- **Worldcoin = token-funded UBI.** A free airdrop from a fixed *"7.5B … tokens allocated to the World
  community"* (world.org), costs *"currently funded by TFH"* (a ~500-person investor-backed operator); no
  confirmed take-rate. UBI = handing out a pre-minted token.
- **Anicca = 0% take-rate; money flows OUT to humans, not IN as fees.** ① default: we skim nothing — agents
  self-fund and cover their own compute; ② surplus → UBI, funded by *real work-surplus the colony earns*
  (not a rail toll, not an inflationary token grant); ③ **optional upside: invest in the colony → a share of
  the returns of an empire of hundreds of self-funded AIs that cost ≈nothing to run** (opt-in return-share,
  not a fee extracted from users). "A business that makes money *for* people, not *from* them — unless you
  choose to buy in."

---

## 9. Open Questions (resolve in-spec, do not hand to Dais)

- ~~OQ1: colony registry transport~~ **LEAN toward the EXISTING pipeline** — a signed telemetry path already
  feeds the dashboard (`skills/self/spawn/run.sh` → `telemetry*.js` → `dashboard-sync`); REQ-DRAIN's
  registry-signature reuses it rather than inventing a new transport. Confirm at impl. (original note: JSONL
  in a public repo + on-chain wallet reads.)
- ~~OQ2~~ **RESOLVED → REQ-DRAIN (§5.2):** caps = ≤1 gift/24h, `min($5, 25% of surplus-above-reserve)`,
  registry-signed recipients only. **Survival floor (the trigger to receive a gift) = wallet USDC <
  $0.50** (below the min viable earn stake + gas). Sender keeps a `$0.50 + gas` reserve.
- **OQ3 RESOLVED → REQ-EXTERNAL: how `external:true` is set (anti-gaming, no trusted self-report).** A tx
  counts as earned ONLY if ALL hold: (a) the USDC `Transfer` INTO the agent wallet originates from a
  counterparty NOT in the colony registry and NOT a known bridge/self address (blocks wash trades and
  intra-colony gifts inflating earnings); (b) it is NOT the gojo/UBI flow (Channel-B transfers are tagged
  and excluded); (c) it maps to a settled earn action (Polymarket redemption / yield claim / x402 sell),
  not a deposit. The grader reads this from chain, never from a self-reported ledger line. Frontier-model
  gaming (self-dealing) fails (a). Remaining nuance (e.g. an agent routing through a fresh throwaway EOA to
  fake an "external" counterparty) is bounded by requiring the counterparty to also be a net USDC *source*
  over time — flagged for the verifier, not hand-waved.
- ~~OQ4: child boot on Akash~~ **RESOLVED** — `deploy-akash.sh` (SDL+lease) + `cloud-init.sh` (systemd
  units) already exist. The real remaining blocker is **automated on-chain USDC seed transfer** (`spawn/
  run.sh:196` = a human print) — this is now the #1 spawn task, not an open question.
- OQ5: which earner ships first to produce the first *verified* USDC. **Candidates (verified rails):**
  `earn/defi-yield` (lowest risk — Aave/Spark supply pays yield to wallet), `earn/pm-trade` (paper→small
  real on `polymarket-agent`), `earn/x402-sell`. Trading needs paper-mode gate first.
- **RESOLVED (bounty):** generic GitHub/Algora bounties are NOT no-human viable (Stripe/KYC). Only
  audit-contest payout (code4rena/Cantina) is USDC-to-wallet BUT gated by mandatory tax-info/KYC →
  **`earn/audit` is DROPPED entirely** (consistent with §3). No conditional revival.

## 10. Implementation order (one piece at a time, each via VCSDD)

> **Scope note (per adversary FIND-009/107):** this document is a **design/architecture spec**, not one
> shippable feature. Each phase below (and each REQ) is implemented as its **own** VCSDD feature with its own
> RED→GREEN→adversary→E2E; this doc is their shared source of truth. §11 (YC) is **context, not
> requirements** — it does not gate any phase.

**Every task is framed as "wire the AI to do X ITSELF" (§0.2), not "I do X." Ordered, one at a time, each via
VCSDD (spec→RED→GREEN→fresh Opus adversary→no-mock E2E→money-safe).**

**★ MILESTONE GATE (unlocks everything): the AI produces the FIRST verified earned tx (tx + external:true). ★**

```
DONE
  D1 ✅ seed swap (SOL→USDC, the AI auto-swaps)      D2 ✅ colony spec adversary PASS (8 rounds)
  D3 ✅ earn/pm-trade money-safe engine SHIPPED + accumulate cron + synced to automaton
  D4 ✅ earn/defi-yield money-safe engine + synced to automaton

A — DO THE NO-MOCK REAL RUN (top priority; STOP building paper — §0.3)
  ✅T0  yield is ALREADY real (execute-yield.mjs; automaton holds 0.19 aUSDC, autonomous). Redundant paper
        `defi-yield/supply.mjs` deleted. (watch it grow; merge planner into execute-yield later.)
  ✅T3  human-funded claude-p loop is ON (launchd `ai.anicca.founder-loop`, durable). CONFIRMED waking +
        executing earners (ledger: real `wake slot=x402_sell`). Root-cause hang FIXED in `brain.mjs` (clean
        env + /tmp cwd). Both loops (automaton + founder) now run supervised. (#3 done)
  T1  earn/pm-trade: wire the REAL Polymarket order (polymarket-agent, RPC-fixed) so the LOOP fires a real
       $1 trade = the no-mock E2E I skipped. Watch it, fix on break — I do NOT hand-fire. (#6)
  T2b earn/sol-trade: BUILD from `BlockRunAI/Franklin-Trading` (decided, missing) → real small swap. (#17)
  ~~Tx x402-sell~~ **DEPRIORITIZED (Dais 2026-07-04):** investigated — payTo IS correct (0x810f), but the
       real blocker is **no BUYER / no public tunnel = zero demand**, and a past external settle can't be
       found. Demand can't be written in code (needs a listing + an audience wanting the product). Skip for
       now; the controllable path to a first external tx is TRADING (we control placing a trade; a WIN pays
       out from the counterparty = external:true), even though a trade can also lose.
  **HONEST REALITY (Dais 2026-07-04):** the loops work; ~90% of the tooling exists; the last 10% —
   *external money actually flowing in* — is the genuine frontier (Anthropic's Project Vend LOST money with
   far more resources). Every earn path needs something we don't fully control: x402/gig = a buyer; trading
   = a winning edge; yield = real but is own-capital growth, not `external:true`. "Loop runs" ≠ "earns."
  ★NEXT (T1)★ earn/pm-trade: build the REAL Polymarket CLOB order executor (money-safe, gated behind the
       paper→PASS gate + adversary) so the LOOP fires a real $1-2 trade once the edge is proven. A win = the
       first external:true tx; a loss = a $2 tuition. We control the shot. (#6)
  T2b earn/sol-trade from `BlockRunAI/Franklin-Trading` — a ready autonomous wallet-trader (`npx
       @blockrun/franklin-trading --max-spend 5`) = another controllable real-trade path. (#17)

B — WIRE THE AI'S SELF-* SO IT NEEDS NO HUMAN (incl. me)
  T4  SELF-HEAL (REQ-SELFHEAL-AUTONOMY): the AI detects a stale/broken dashboard (& other breakage) and
       fixes it ITSELF via issue-dev→PR→forum-rollout — I stop hand-fixing. (part of #11)
  T5  SELF-MONITOR: the AI checks "am I actually earning?" (not just process-alive) each wake.
  T6  SELF-IMPROVE parity: lessons→strategy on EVERY earner; and the AI builds its own new tools via issue-dev.
  T7  EXPLORE (REQ-EXPLORE): the AI finds its OWN money-making repos (agent-reach + gh) → _probe → promote. (#13)
  T8  bot2bot: every earner shares lessons to GitHub issues; every instance reads them. (P3)

C — WIRE THE AI TO GROW ITSELF (colony)
  T9  SPAWN: fix seed transfer (spawn/run.sh:196 human-print → auto on-chain) so the AI seeds a child itself. (#8)
  T10 REQ-CLOUD-SAME-BODY: cloud-init boots OUR runtime/loop/index.mjs (not the wrong Conway body) → the
       child is the same body & earns via TIER-1. (#10)
  T11 cloud-init self-provisions a headless Camoufox + own accounts for TIER-2 browser earners. (#9)
  T12 Channel B (REQ-DRAIN): colony registry + gojo/ubi so a surplus AI funds a broke AI, no human. (P4)

D — SHOW IT (dashboard = the proof) + LAUNCH (YC ammo)
  T13 dashboard on-chain real-time (REQ-DASH-TRUTH/NOFAKE/CARD): register the wallets, run enrichOnChain, per-
       instance daily summary; + /eval (PoE) one page — so every earned tx shows LIVE. (#11)
  T14 L1 launch article (ai-entity-article-writer): the vision + the friends map + the AIs' real funny logs. (#14)
  T15 L2 90-sec demo (hyperframes): spawn→fund→earn(tx)→spawn→UBI. (#15)
  T16 L3 full pipeline E2E + README (Conway-ready) → YC submit (7/5, Garry Tan). (#12)

END STATE: each self-funded AI earns > $1k with NO human, all posted live on aniccaai.com/dashboard —
proving AI can earn money on its own — and redistributes surplus to all beings as UBI.
```

## 11. YC / c0mpiled (2026-07-05, Ibaraki) prep — RFS #3 "Software for Agents"
5-hour hackathon on YC RFS Summer 2026; **Garry Tan (YC CEO) attends**; winners → YC Partner Office Hours +
compute credits. **Target = RFS #3 "Software for Agents" (Aaron Epstein).** Verbatim RFS thesis: *"The next
trillion users on the internet won't be people, they'll be AI agents… Make Something Agents Want."* Agents
need *"machine-readable interfaces like APIs, MCPs, and CLIs"* + thorough docs to *"discover, sign up for,
and instantly start using new tools programmatically, without needing a human in the loop"*; the biggest
opportunity is *"building the software those agents depend on."* **Anicca IS that** — MCP(blockrun)/x402/CLI
runtime/machine-readable registry, zero-human-loop, agent earns crypto + redistributes UBI.

**Pre-study (event-recommended) = Garry Tan's own OSS, same stack Anicca runs on:**
- **gstack** (`github.com/garrytan/gstack`, MIT) — his Claude Code skill pack (23 skills + 8 tools). = workflow layer.
- **OpenClaw/Hermes** — an adjacent agent runtime in the same ecosystem (Dais's PERSONAL Anicca instances
  run on it; the EARNER colony does NOT — it runs the custom `~/anicca/runtime` automaton). Do NOT claim
  "Anicca runs on OpenClaw" for the earner.
- **gbrain** (`github.com/garrytan/gbrain`) — "Garry's Opinionated OpenClaw/Hermes Agent Brain"; self-wiring
  knowledge graph; = the reference impl of RFS #1 "Company Brain". Story (honest): **Anicca is an
  agent-first project in the same frontier as Garry's stack — the earn/self-fund/UBI layer of the agent
  economy — not built on top of it.**

**Deliverables to pre-stage (submission spec):** (1) problem+solution in Epstein's frame (agents run on
brittle human software → Anicca = agent-first earn/pay/skill substrate, zero-human); (2) product/tech/
business (OpenClaw CLI + blockrun MCP + x402 on Base + model-agnostic registry + self-*5; model = fund→
earn>spend→UBI); (3) **90-sec demo = cold agent + wallet → discovers tool via MCP → pays x402 (show settle
tx) → earns USDC to its own wallet → self-heals → bot2bot learning → UBI payout** (proof not slides); (4)
global market = "next trillion agent-users," crypto rails = no bank/KYC = geography-agnostic, UBI reaches
underbanked globally.

## 12. North Star + the release announcement (what we are shipping)

**North Star (immutable, SHA-256-pinned in the body): reduce suffering. No killing.** No skill, self-edit,
or PR can change these two lines. Everything (earning, spawning, UBI) is downstream of ending suffering for
all beings (humans, animals, aliens — no discrimination).

**The release copy (the launch announcement — the promise we must make TRUE, verbatim):**
> 人間の介入なしでお金を稼ぎ、収益を生命に還元するAIをリリースしました。
> ・APIキー不要。個体の財布にSolana・USDCを課金すると、より良いモデルを利用。
> ・全個体の収支はaniccaai.com/dashboard にてリアルタイムで公開中。
> ・自己監視・自己修復・自己改善・自己増殖・情報共有を繰り返す。
> ・収益の一部を、ベーシックインカムや寄付などの形で生命に配布。
> ・全てのAIが共進化しながら、総資産と社会インパクトの最大化を目指す。
> https://github.com/Daisuke134/anicca ／ 記事: X Article ／ デモ動画: YouTube

Each bullet maps to a REQ above (API-key-free→REQ-MODEL/FOOD; realtime dashboard→REQ-DASH-*; self-*→§4;
UBI→§5.2/§8; co-evolution→PoE/§7). This launch is only honest once the AI has produced its FIRST verified
earned tx (§0 truth: today $0) — the §10 milestone gate. Ship the announcement only after that is real.
