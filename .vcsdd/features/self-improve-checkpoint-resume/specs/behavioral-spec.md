  - `openevolve-run --help` (run live in this worktree's venv, `~/.anicca-venvs/self-improve/bin/

    CHECKPOINT   Path to checkpoint directory to resume from (e.g.,
    openevolve_output/checkpoints/checkpoint_50)` — this feature adds exactly this flag, no new
    mechanism invented

    already an anticipated, designed-for capability of this harness, just never wired into
    `run_evolve.sh`'s automatic recurring invocation
  - direct log inspection this session (real `runs/*/assessment.json` files under this worktree's
    launchd-produced production body, read by the parent agent-economy loop, not hypothesized):
    three consecutive ~6h cycles (`run-20260710T190919Z`, `run-20260711T011638Z`,
    `run-20260711T072156Z`) each produced a best-candidate `combined_score` numerically IDENTICAL
    to `baseline_stage2_score` (e.g. `4.015488840463803` to many decimal places) — `stage2_pass`
    was `False` (a tie never counts as "beats baseline") every time, so zero candidates reached the
    fresh-adversary review step for 18+ hours despite the loop firing, iterating, and logging
    normally

    - promote_gate.sh / lib/promote_gate.py / lib/promote.py (the promotion-gate step downstream of

      `run_evolve.sh` with no arguments this feature needs to change)
  out_of_scope_this_phase:
    - Any change to `--iterations`/`SELF_IMPROVE_ITERATIONS` (REQ-OE5's per-run budget is
      unaffected; this feature makes MORE of each run's iterations count toward NEW exploration by
      not re-deriving the same starting population, but does not itself raise the per-run cap)
    - Cross-run checkpoint garbage collection / retention policy for `runs/*/checkpoints/` (old
      checkpoint directories accumulate on disk exactly as they do today; a future feature may
      prune them — not specified here)

# Behavioral Specification — self-improve-checkpoint-resume (Phase 1a)

## Purpose

`run_evolve.sh` fires on a recurring ~6h launchd timer (REQ-OE7). Every firing creates a brand-new
`runs/run-<timestamp>/` directory and invokes `openevolve-run` with `initial_program =
strategies/pm_backtest_strategy.py` (the single committed baseline) and NO `--checkpoint` flag.
`openevolve-run` itself already checkpoints its MAP-Elites population under `<output>/checkpoints/
checkpoint_<N>/` every `checkpoint_interval` iterations (config.yaml line 11) — but because the
next cycle never points at ANY prior run's checkpoint, that population is discarded at the end of
every cycle. Each cycle re-starts from a population of exactly one program (the seed) and gets only
`ITERATIONS` (today 20-40) total iterations to both rediscover and try to beat the same
already-known-optimum baseline from a cold start — which is the directly-observed, confirmed-live
root cause of three consecutive ~6h cycles producing a tied (never-improving) `combined_score` and
zero forward progress for 18+ hours (see sources above).

This feature adds ONE pre-invocation step to `run_evolve.sh`: before calling `openevolve-run`, look
for the most recent PRIOR run's highest-numbered checkpoint and pass it via `--checkpoint <path>` —
an existing, already-installed, already-documented `openevolve-run` CLI flag, not a new mechanism.
When no prior checkpoint exists (first-ever run, or every prior run crashed before
`checkpoint_interval`), the command runs exactly as it does today — this feature strictly ADDS an
optional flag, it never removes or alters the existing fallback path.

This is a harness-only change: no strategy file, promotion gate, live-money path, or launchd plist
is touched.

## Purity Boundary Analysis

- **Pure core (this feature's entire testable surface):** `lib/checkpoint_resume.py::
  find_latest_checkpoint(runs_dir: str, current_run_id: str) -> Optional[str]`. Given a `runs_dir`
  path and the CURRENT run's own ID (so it never picks itself), it decides which checkpoint path
  (if any) to resume from. It is deterministic path/existence logic ONLY: `os.listdir`,
  `os.path.isdir`, string parsing/sorting — no subprocess, no network, no mutation of anything on
  disk, no reading of ANY file's byte contents (it never opens/parses a checkpoint's internal
  files — see REQ-CR5). Same input directory tree → same output, every time, in-process.
- **Effectful shell:** `run_evolve.sh`'s existing bash — it already creates `$RUN_DIR`, invokes
  `openevolve-run`, and appends to `$LOG` (REQ-OE6/OE7, unchanged conventions). This feature adds
  exactly one new effectful step to that shell script: shell out to the pure function via a thin
  CLI entrypoint living INSIDE `lib/checkpoint_resume.py` itself (its own `if __name__ ==
  "__main__":` block) — this is the ONE committed invocation shape (no alternative form is left
  open; see REQ-CR6 for the exact command line). That entrypoint takes NO argv, reads `RUNS_DIR`
  and `RUN_ID` from the process environment, calls `find_latest_checkpoint(runs_dir=os.environ[
  "RUNS_DIR"], current_run_id=os.environ["RUN_ID"])`, and prints EXACTLY one line to stdout — the
  resulting path, or an empty string when `None` — nothing else. This entrypoint's own effects are
  strictly limited to reading `os.environ` and writing to stdout: it NEVER itself creates, deletes,
  renames, or writes bytes to any file or directory (REQ-CR11) — its only output channel is that one
  stdout line; any subsequent logging of that output to `$LOG` is `run_evolve.sh`'s own
  responsibility (REQ-CR9), not this Python entrypoint's. This is a byte-for-byte mirror of
  `lib/ledger_reader.py`'s own established convention (confirmed live, `lib/ledger_reader.py:222-
  225`: no argv, reads its own env-derived config internally, prints one line of JSON to stdout;
  called from `run_evolve.sh:60` as `"$PY_BIN" "$SKILL_DIR/lib/ledger_reader.py"`, no `-c`, no
  extra args). `run_evolve.sh` invokes it BEFORE the `openevolve-run` invocation, captures its
  stdout, logs the outcome, and conditionally appends `--checkpoint "<path>"` to the existing
  command array. `openevolve-run` itself (a separate process, already effectful, unchanged by this
  feature) is what actually reads the checkpoint directory's contents and resumes from it — that
  read is entirely outside this feature's own code.

## EARS-Format Functional Requirements

### Group CR-FIND — pure checkpoint discovery

- **REQ-CR1** `lib/checkpoint_resume.py` SHALL expose a PURE function `find_latest_checkpoint(
  runs_dir: str, current_run_id: str) -> Optional[str]` that returns the absolute path to a
  checkpoint directory to resume from, or `None` when no prior run has any usable checkpoint. This
  function SHALL itself normalize its return value to an absolute path via `os.path.abspath` (never
  relying on the caller happening to pass an already-absolute `runs_dir`) — i.e. calling it with a
  RELATIVE `runs_dir` (e.g. `"runs"`, resolved against the current working directory) SHALL still
  return an absolute path string, not a relative one, making REQ-CR1's "absolute path" contract true
  by construction rather than true only by accident of production's `RUNS_DIR` always being
  absolute.

- **REQ-CR2** WHEN selecting which PRIOR RUN to resume from, THE SYSTEM SHALL: list the immediate
  entries of `runs_dir`, filter that list down to ONLY entries whose name matches REQ-CR10's
  run-directory-name shape (this step is unconditional and happens BEFORE any other filtering — an
  entry that does not match REQ-CR10's shape, such as the real, always-present `runs/db` sibling
  directory created by `config.yaml`'s `database.db_path: "runs/db"` — see EDGE-CR10 — is NEVER a
  candidate, regardless of what it contains or how it sorts), EXCLUDE any remaining entry equal
  to `current_run_id`, sort the REMAINING run-shaped candidate names lexicographically DESCENDING
  (run directory names are `run-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` UTC timestamps, which sort correctly as plain
  strings — REQ-OE7's existing naming convention, unchanged), and THEN iterate that sorted list IN
  ORDER, calling REQ-CR3's per-run checkpoint selector on each candidate in turn: the FIRST
  candidate for which REQ-CR3 returns a non-`None` checkpoint path is the one used, and iteration
  STOPS there (REQ-CR3's result for that candidate IS the function's overall result, modulo
  REQ-CR1's absolute-path contract). A candidate for which REQ-CR3 returns `None` (for ANY reason —
  no `checkpoints/` subdirectory at all, an empty one, one that is non-empty at the OS-listing
  level but contains ZERO valid `checkpoint_<N>`-shaped entries (see EDGE-CR11), or the candidate
  entry matching REQ-CR10's name shape being a PLAIN FILE rather than a directory (see EDGE-CR12) —
  REQ-CR3 treats a same-named file exactly like a directory with no `checkpoints/` subdirectory:
  `None`, never a raised `NotADirectoryError`/`FileNotFoundError`) is skipped (not selected, not a
  fatal error) and iteration CONTINUES to the next-most-recent candidate. If the
  entire sorted candidate list is exhausted with every candidate returning `None` from REQ-CR3 (or
  the list was empty to begin with), THE SYSTEM SHALL return `None` (REQ-CR4). This iterate-until-
  a-real-checkpoint-or-exhausted rule is the ONLY selection algorithm this function implements —
  there is no early return on "first candidate encountered," only on "first candidate that
  actually yields a usable checkpoint."

- **REQ-CR3** GIVEN a single candidate run directory (as selected by REQ-CR2's iteration), THE
  SYSTEM SHALL: if that directory has no `checkpoints/` subdirectory at all, return `None`
  immediately. Otherwise, list `checkpoints/`'s immediate entries and consider ONLY those whose
  name matches the literal pattern `checkpoint_<N>` where `<N>` is one or more ASCII digits — any
  entry that does NOT match this pattern (a stray file such as `.DS_Store`, a differently-named
  directory, a hidden dotfile) SHALL be ignored and SHALL NEVER raise an exception or abort the
  scan. If, after this filter, there are ZERO matching entries — whether because `checkpoints/` was
  literally empty (zero entries of any kind) OR because it was non-empty at the OS-listing level
  but every entry present failed the `checkpoint_<N>` shape test (EDGE-CR11) — THE SYSTEM SHALL
  return `None` for this candidate (these two cases are INDISTINGUISHABLE in their outcome: both
  mean "this candidate has no usable checkpoint," and REQ-CR2's caller treats both identically as a
  reason to move on to the next-most-recent candidate). Otherwise (at least one matching entry
  exists), parse each matching entry's `<N>` as an INTEGER (not a string) and return the absolute
  path of the entry with the LARGEST integer `<N>` (e.g. `checkpoint_100` SHALL be selected over
  `checkpoint_20` — NEVER a lexicographic comparison, which would incorrectly rank `checkpoint_20`
  above `checkpoint_100`).

- **REQ-CR10** A `runs_dir` entry SHALL be considered a candidate run directory (eligible for
  REQ-CR2's iteration at all) ONLY IF its name matches the literal shape `run-` followed by exactly
  the UTC timestamp format this repo's own `run_evolve.sh:50` already produces (`run-$(date -u
  +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`, i.e. `run-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`: 8 ASCII digits, literal `T`, 6 ASCII digits,
  literal `Z`) — concretely, a regex equivalent to `^run-\d{8}T\d{6}Z$`. This is the ONLY test used
  to decide "is this a run directory" — it is applied BEFORE, and independently of, the
  `current_run_id` exclusion, and independently of whatever the entry contains (a directory or a
  file, empty or not). Any entry that does not match this shape — including, concretely, the real
  `runs/db` sibling directory that `config.yaml`'s `database.db_path: "runs/db"` causes
  `openevolve-run` to create directly under `runs_dir` on every real production cycle (confirmed:
  `skills/earn/self-improve/config.yaml:129`) — is EXCLUDED from candidacy entirely, never
  considered, never inspected for a `checkpoints/` subdirectory, regardless of its lexicographic
  sort position relative to any `run-*` name.

- **REQ-CR4** WHEN `runs_dir` does not exist at all, is empty, contains ONLY the excluded
  `current_run_id` entry, contains ONLY entries that fail REQ-CR10's run-directory-name shape
  filter (e.g. `runs_dir` contains only `db`, per EDGE-CR10, and no `run-*` entry at all), OR every
  run-shaped candidate's REQ-CR3 result is `None` (REQ-CR2's iteration exhausted), THE SYSTEM SHALL
  return `None` — this is the ordinary, expected "no usable prior checkpoint" case, not an error
  condition.

- **REQ-CR5** `find_latest_checkpoint` SHALL perform PATH/EXISTENCE logic only (directory listing,
  name pattern matching, integer comparison). It SHALL NEVER open, read, or validate the byte
  contents of any file inside a `checkpoint_<N>` directory (no checking for openevolve's own
  expected internal files, no deserializing any checkpoint state). Whether a selected checkpoint
  directory is internally complete/valid enough for `openevolve-run` to actually resume from is
  ENTIRELY `openevolve-run`'s own concern, at a LATER, separate point in the pipeline (REQ-CR7) —
  this function's contract ends at "a directory matching the expected shape and naming convention
  exists at this path."

### Group CR-WIRE — wiring into run_evolve.sh

- **REQ-CR6** `run_evolve.sh` SHALL invoke `lib/checkpoint_resume.py`'s CLI entrypoint via EXACTLY
  the command `RUNS_DIR="$RUNS_DIR" RUN_ID="$RUN_ID" "$PY_BIN" "$SKILL_DIR/lib/checkpoint_resume.py"`
  — no `-c` inline snippet, no positional argv, environment-variable assignment ONLY, mirroring
  `lib/ledger_reader.py`'s existing `"$PY_BIN" "$SKILL_DIR/lib/ledger_reader.py"` call shape
  (`run_evolve.sh:60`) exactly, with the sole addition of the two inline env-var assignments this
  module needs that `ledger_reader.py` does not. This call happens AFTER `$RUN_DIR` is created (so
  `RUN_ID` = the just-created `$RUN_ID`, correctly excluding itself even though its own now-empty
  directory already exists under `runs/`) and BEFORE the existing `"$OPENEVOLVE_BIN"` invocation.
  `run_evolve.sh` SHALL capture this call's stdout verbatim as the checkpoint path (an empty string
  meaning "no checkpoint found," per REQ-CR8). `run_evolve.sh` SHALL ALSO explicitly capture this
  call's own exit status (via `$?` immediately after the command substitution) separately from its
  stdout — NOTE this is a NEW capture this feature introduces, not a reuse of an existing pattern:
  the existing OBSERVE step at `run_evolve.sh:58-64` calls `ledger_reader.py` via a bare
  `OBSERVE_JSON="$(...)"` command substitution and never inspects its exit status at all (any
  failure there is silently absorbed into an empty/error-shaped `$OBSERVE_JSON` string, logged as
  data, never treated as a distinct branch) — see REQ-CR12 for what THIS feature does with a
  non-zero exit, which is stricter than that existing precedent, not a copy of it.

- **REQ-CR12** WHEN the REQ-CR6 call itself exits non-zero (the `checkpoint_resume.py` process
  crashed, raised an uncaught exception, or `$PY_BIN` was not executable) — as DISTINCT from the
  call succeeding and simply returning an empty string — THE SYSTEM SHALL treat this exactly like
  the REQ-CR8 "no checkpoint found" fallback for the PURPOSES of the `openevolve-run` invocation
  (no `--checkpoint` flag; run proceeds as a cold start — resuming is a pure optimization to this
  harness, never a precondition for it to run at all, the same "degrade, never block" posture the
  existing OBSERVE/`ledger_reader.py` step already takes at `run_evolve.sh:58-64`), BUT the log
  line this case produces (per REQ-CR9) SHALL be a THIRD, distinct wording — the literal substring
  `checkpoint_resume: resume-check crashed` followed by the captured exit status — so a crashed
  lookup is never silently conflated with, or indistinguishable in the log from, an ordinary
  "no prior run exists yet" cold start. This is the one and only new failure-handling branch
  REQ-CR7 defers to; it governs solely the REQ-CR6 helper call's own exit status, never
  `openevolve-run`'s (that remains REQ-OE6's existing concern, unchanged).

- **REQ-CR7** WHEN the REQ-CR6 call returns a non-empty checkpoint path, THE SYSTEM SHALL append
  exactly one additional argument pair, `--checkpoint "<path>"`, to the EXISTING `openevolve-run`
  invocation (unchanged otherwise: same `initial_program`, `evaluation_file`, `--config`,
  `--iterations`, `--output` arguments, in the same order) — `openevolve-run`'s OWN internal
  behavior when given a `--checkpoint` path (including how it handles an internally
  incomplete/corrupt one) is entirely `openevolve-run`'s concern; if it fails or exits non-zero for
  that reason, that failure SHALL surface through the EXISTING REQ-OE6 "crashed run is inconclusive"
  handling in `run_evolve.sh` — this feature introduces NO new failure-handling branch for that
  case.

- **REQ-CR8** WHEN the REQ-CR6 call returns empty/`None` (no prior checkpoint found, for ANY reason
  — first-ever run, all prior runs lack a `checkpoints/` dir, or `runs_dir` itself is missing), THE
  SYSTEM SHALL invoke `openevolve-run` with EXACTLY the same argument list it uses today (no
  `--checkpoint` flag at all) — i.e. this feature's fallback path is byte-for-byte the pre-existing
  behavior, never a degraded or different variant of it.

- **REQ-CR9** THE SYSTEM SHALL append EXACTLY one log line to `$LOG` (the same
  `echo "$(now) <message>" >> "$LOG"` file/convention every other `run_evolve.sh` step already
  writes to, e.g. `run_evolve.sh:91`'s `echo "$(now) run_id=$RUN_ID status=$STATUS" >> "$LOG"`) on
  EVERY invocation of this feature's new step — this decision SHALL NEVER be silent, and its content
  SHALL NEVER be merely "some line got written" (a bare line-count check is not sufficient evidence
  this requirement holds; the line's TEXT is pinned below so a test can assert on it directly).
  There are exactly THREE mutually-exclusive branches, each with its own pinned, verbatim substring
  (so two independent implementers cannot diverge on wording, and a test can assert on this exact
  content in ALL THREE branches, never merely `count(lines) == 1`):
  1. REQ-CR6 call exits zero AND returns a non-empty checkpoint path: the log line's message SHALL
     contain the literal substring `checkpoint_resume: resuming from checkpoint` immediately
     followed by the actual resolved path.
  2. REQ-CR6 call exits zero AND returns empty/`None` (no prior checkpoint found, for any reason):
     the log line's message SHALL contain the literal substring
     `checkpoint_resume: no prior checkpoint found`.
  3. REQ-CR6 call itself exits non-zero (REQ-CR12's crash case): the log line's message SHALL
     contain the literal substring `checkpoint_resume: resume-check crashed` immediately followed
     by the captured exit status — a concrete, non-blank, informative string in every branch, not a
     generic placeholder.

### Group CR-SAFETY — no filesystem mutation, anywhere in this feature's code

- **REQ-CR11** Neither `find_latest_checkpoint` NOR `lib/checkpoint_resume.py`'s `__main__` CLI
  entrypoint (REQ-CR6) SHALL EVER call any filesystem-mutating API. Concretely, this module's own
  source code (in both the pure function and the `__main__` block) SHALL NEVER call: `os.remove`,
  `os.unlink`, `os.rmdir`, `os.removedirs`, `os.mkdir`, `os.makedirs`, `os.rename`, `os.replace`,
  `os.truncate`, `os.symlink`, `os.link`, any `shutil.*` function (`shutil.rmtree`, `shutil.copy*`,
  `shutil.move`, etc.), `open(...)` with any mode other than the implicit read-only default (i.e.
  never `'w'`, `'a'`, `'x'`, `'w+'`, or any other write/append/create/truncate mode), NOR any
  `pathlib.Path` mutating method (`Path.unlink`, `Path.rmdir`, `Path.mkdir`, `Path.rename`,
  `Path.replace`, `Path.touch`, `Path.write_text`, `Path.write_bytes`, `Path.symlink_to`,
  `Path.hardlink_to`, or any other `Path` method that creates/deletes/renames/writes) — nor any
  equivalent operation that creates, deletes, renames, or writes bytes to a file or directory. THE
  ONLY filesystem operations this module's runtime code MAY perform are READ-ONLY directory
  traversal: `os.listdir`, `os.scandir`, and `os.path.*` queries (`isdir`, `isfile`, `exists`,
  `join`, `abspath`, etc.) — listing directory entries and inspecting their names/existence, NEVER
  opening or reading the byte contents of any file (this restates and sharpens REQ-CR5's "no
  file-content reads" rule to also explicitly cover the `__main__` entrypoint, not only the pure
  function). This module SHALL NOT import `pathlib` at all (`os`/`os.path` suffice for every
  operation REQ-CR1-CR10 require), which makes the "no `pathlib.Path` mutation" half of this
  requirement structurally trivial to verify (an import-scan alone proves it) rather than requiring
  an exhaustive enumeration of every `Path` mutating method. The `__main__` entrypoint's only
  permitted output channel is stdout (REQ-CR6); it never writes to any file. This requirement makes
  INV-CR1 directly traceable to an explicit, testable REQ (closing the gap where INV-CR1 previously
  had no REQ or test enforcing it) and is verified by PROP-CR12 (static denylist scan + a `pathlib`
  import-absence scan + dynamic before/after directory-snapshot comparison).

## Global Invariants

| # | Invariant |
|---|---|
| INV-CR1 | `find_latest_checkpoint` AND `lib/checkpoint_resume.py`'s `__main__` entrypoint NEVER write, delete, rename, or mutate anything on disk — both are pure/read-only with respect to the filesystem (REQ-CR5, REQ-CR11) |
| INV-CR2 | This feature never touches `strategies/pm_backtest_strategy.py`, `promote_gate.sh`, `lib/promote_gate.py`, `lib/promote.py`, `config.yaml`, or `ai.anicca.self-improve-evolve.plist` (verified by PROP-CR9/PROP-CR12's source-text scans over `lib/checkpoint_resume.py`, which contain no reference to any of these paths, plus a plain `git diff` scope check at review time showing no other file touched) |
| INV-CR3 | This feature never reads or writes any wallet key, `.env`, ledger file, or spend-cap value — it is scoped exclusively to `runs/*/checkpoints/*` path selection (verified by PROP-CR9's source-text scan finding no `open(`/network reference, PLUS the same `git diff` scope check as INV-CR2 — no wallet/`.env`/ledger file appears in this feature's diff) |
| INV-CR4 | The fallback path (no checkpoint found) is byte-for-byte identical, in its `openevolve-run` invocation, to `run_evolve.sh`'s pre-feature behavior (REQ-CR8) — this feature can only ADD a `--checkpoint` argument, never change any other existing argument |
| INV-CR5 | REQ-OE6's "a crashed/killed/timed-out openevolve run is inconclusive, no candidate promoted, baseline untouched" invariant is preserved unchanged — this feature adds no new promotion path and does not weaken that handling for a `--checkpoint`-resumed run (verified by PROP-CR-WIRE1/PROP-CR-WIRE2/PROP-CR-WIRE2b together: the `openevolve-run` invocation's existing arguments and its downstream `STATUS=$?`/`promote_gate.sh` handling, both already outside this feature's diff, are shown byte-for-byte unchanged in every branch) |

## Edge Cases

- **EDGE-CR1** (mirrors the prior phase's already-established EDGE-RL5a pattern) `runs/` is
  gitignored (confirmed: this worktree's own `skills/earn/self-improve/.gitignore` contains
  `runs/`) — a fresh dev worktree checkout has NO `runs/` directory at all. Tests for
  `find_latest_checkpoint` MUST construct a synthetic `runs_dir` tree under `tmp_path` (pytest
  fixture), never rely on or read this worktree's own (nonexistent) `runs/` directory, and MUST
  NEVER symlink or copy any real production `runs/` directory into a worktree.
- **EDGE-CR2** No `runs/` directory exists at all (very first invocation ever) → REQ-CR4 → `None` →
  REQ-CR8 fallback.
- **EDGE-CR3** `runs/` exists but is empty, or contains ONLY the current run's own just-created
  directory → REQ-CR4 → `None` → REQ-CR8 fallback.
- **EDGE-CR4** A prior run directory exists but has no `checkpoints/` subdirectory at all (e.g. it
  crashed before `checkpoint_interval` iterations, or predates this feature) → REQ-CR3 returns
  `None` for it → REQ-CR2's iteration skips it and continues to the next-most-recent run-shaped
  candidate; if none qualifies, REQ-CR4 → `None`.
- **EDGE-CR5** A prior run directory has a `checkpoints/` subdirectory that is present but literally
  EMPTY (zero entries of any kind) → REQ-CR3 returns `None` for it (same treatment as EDGE-CR4:
  skipped, iteration continues).
- **EDGE-CR6** A `checkpoints/` directory contains non-`checkpoint_<N>`-shaped entries (a stray
  file, a hidden dotfile, a directory with a non-numeric suffix) interleaved with AT LEAST ONE
  valid `checkpoint_<N>` entry → REQ-CR3 ignores the non-matching entries and selects correctly
  among the valid ones; their mere presence never raises an exception. (Contrast EDGE-CR11, where
  ZERO valid entries survive the filter.)
- **EDGE-CR7** Multiple prior runs each have checkpoints; the most recent run BY DIRECTORY NAME has
  fewer/lower-numbered checkpoints than an older run (e.g. it crashed early). REQ-CR2 still selects
  the MOST RECENT run (by directory-name recency), NOT the run with the globally highest checkpoint
  number — "resume from the last cycle's population" is defined as most-recent-cycle, not
  highest-ever-checkpoint-count, so this feature keeps extending the SAME chronological lineage
  rather than possibly reaching further back in time.
- **EDGE-CR8** The selected checkpoint directory exists (by REQ-CR3's path logic) but is internally
  incomplete/corrupt (missing files `openevolve-run` itself needs to resume) — explicitly OUT of
  this function's responsibility (REQ-CR5); if `openevolve-run` then fails to resume, that surfaces
  as REQ-OE6's existing "crashed run is inconclusive" handling, not a new failure mode this feature
  must detect or prevent.
- **EDGE-CR9** `current_run_id` happens to already have its OWN (freshly created, necessarily empty)
  directory present under `runs_dir` at scan time (true in practice, since `run_evolve.sh` creates
  `$RUN_DIR` before calling this function, per REQ-CR6) — REQ-CR2's explicit exclusion of
  `current_run_id` prevents a run from ever "resuming from itself."
- **EDGE-CR10** `runs_dir` contains a real, always-present, non-run-shaped sibling entry that is NOT
  a run directory at all: `runs/db`, created directly under `runs_dir` by `config.yaml`'s
  `database.db_path: "runs/db"` (confirmed: `skills/earn/self-improve/config.yaml:129`; this is not
  hypothetical — it is a real directory openevolve itself writes on every production cycle, e.g.
  "Loaded database with 82 programs from runs/db" per prior-phase live logs). REQ-CR10's
  run-directory-name shape filter (`^run-\d{8}T\d{6}Z$`) EXCLUDES `db` from candidacy entirely,
  before any lexicographic sort and before any `checkpoints/` inspection — it is NEVER selected,
  NEVER treated as "the most recent candidate," regardless of its name's sort position relative to
  `run-*` names.
- **EDGE-CR11** A run-shaped candidate directory's `checkpoints/` subdirectory is non-empty at the
  OS-listing level (`os.listdir` returns >= 1 entry) but contains ZERO entries matching the
  `checkpoint_<N>` shape — for example, only a stray macOS `.DS_Store` file (a concrete,
  environment-grounded risk: this repo's own CLAUDE.md names the production execution host as a
  Mac Mini, where Finder/Spotlight can drop `.DS_Store` into any browsed/indexed directory). This is
  NOT the same test as "non-empty `checkpoints/` dir" (contrast EDGE-CR6, where at least one valid
  entry survives). Per REQ-CR3, this candidate returns `None` (treated identically to EDGE-CR4/
  EDGE-CR5, NOT as an error) and REQ-CR2's iteration falls through to the next-most-recent
  run-shaped candidate, continuing until a candidate yields a valid `checkpoint_<N>` entry or the
  sorted candidate list is exhausted (→ REQ-CR4 → `None`). This function SHALL NEVER return early
  or raise merely because `checkpoints/` was non-empty at the OS-listing level.

- **EDGE-CR12** A `runs_dir` entry whose NAME matches REQ-CR10's `run-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` shape is
  itself a PLAIN FILE, not a directory (e.g. a stray zero-byte file left by some unrelated process,
  or a leftover artifact from a killed/interrupted run). REQ-CR3's attempt to inspect this
  candidate's `checkpoints/` subdirectory SHALL treat this exactly like "no `checkpoints/`
  subdirectory exists" — returning `None` for this candidate — and SHALL NEVER let a
  `NotADirectoryError`/`FileNotFoundError`/any other OS-level exception escape `find_latest_
  checkpoint` (this function catches/checks-before-acting, e.g. via `os.path.isdir(...)` before
  attempting to list a `checkpoints/` path underneath it, rather than relying on a bare `os.listdir`
  raising and being caught after the fact). REQ-CR2's iteration then falls through to the
  next-most-recent candidate exactly as EDGE-CR11 does.

## "Done" / 4-D Convergence

| dimension | condition |
|---|---|
| spec | this document + verification-architecture.md |
| test | RED: unit tests for `find_latest_checkpoint` covering REQ-CR1-5, REQ-CR10, REQ-CR11, and EDGE-CR1-11 all written and failing (module does not yet exist) before any implementation; GREEN: all passing |
| impl | `lib/checkpoint_resume.py::find_latest_checkpoint` + `run_evolve.sh`'s new pre-invocation step (REQ-CR6-9), both present and runnable |
| impl review | fresh-context `vcsdd-adversary` review of both files returns PASS (lean mode: no BLOCKING findings) |
| verification | Phase 5: proof obligations in verification-architecture.md discharged; a real, hand-constructed two-run `tmp_path` fixture demonstrates `run_evolve.sh`'s new step selecting and logging the correct `--checkpoint` path end-to-end (or a documented reason it could not be exercised without touching the production `runs/` tree, per EDGE-CR1) |

## UNVERIFIED

- Whether resuming from a stale/older checkpoint (REQ-CR2's "most recent run by directory name,"
  EDGE-CR7) ever meaningfully out-performs the alternative "highest checkpoint number across all
  runs" policy in practice is an empirical question about openevolve's own MAP-Elites dynamics, not
  something this feature's pure path-selection logic can prove — the chronological-lineage choice
  is a documented, defensible design decision (see EDGE-CR7's rationale), not an empirically-tuned
  one. A future feature may revisit this if real cycle-over-cycle score data suggests otherwise.
