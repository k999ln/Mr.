## Verification Strategy

### Tier 0 — Static audit (no test runner)

- `PROP-017`: `grep -rE 'osascript|pbcopy|launchd|open |say '` over `runtime/loop/` must return empty.
  Rationale: macOS exclusion is a structural property detectable by source scan.

### Tier 1 — Property tests with `node:test` (pure-core functions only)

`PROP-001` through `PROP-012`, `PROP-018`, and `PROP-020`.

These are purely functional transforms with no I/O (PROP-020 is pure regex
matching over a string). Each test file imports the pure module, passes inputs,
and asserts outputs. No mocks, no fixtures, no network. Fast (< 50 ms per test).

Test file locations (to be written in Phase 2a):
```
runtime/loop/__tests__/tier.test.mjs
runtime/loop/__tests__/env-filter.test.mjs
runtime/loop/__tests__/ledger-record.test.mjs
runtime/loop/__tests__/loop-detect.test.mjs
runtime/loop/__tests__/parse-tool-call.test.mjs
runtime/loop/__tests__/config.test.mjs
```

### Tier 2 — Integration tests with `node:test` + mock HTTP

`PROP-013` through `PROP-016`, `PROP-019`, `PROP-021`, and `PROP-022`.

These tests spin up the full `index.mjs` entry point in a child process with:
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` pointing to an in-process mock HTTP server (no network).
- `ANICCA_HOME` pointing to a temp directory.
- `SLEEP_BASE_S=0` (no real sleep between wakes).

Each integration test runs for N wakes, then sends SIGTERM (or inspects
`ledger.jsonl`) and asserts the structural post-conditions.

Test file location:
```
runtime/loop/__tests__/integration.test.mjs
```

### Tier 3 — NOT required for this feature

The pure-core functions (Tier 1) are simple enough that property-based testing
via `node:test` with hand-crafted boundary cases fully covers the invariants.
Formal model checking (TLA+, Kani) is out of scope for this sprint.

## Risk Notes

1. **Balance RPC flakiness** (REQ-002, PROP-004): the production Base RPC may timeout during
   integration tests. Integration tests MUST mock the balance call via an env override
   (`ANICCA_BALANCE_OVERRIDE`) so tests are not network-dependent.

2. **Ledger append atomicity** (REQ-007, PROP-014): on Linux `O_APPEND` is atomic for writes
   < PIPE_BUF (4096 bytes). Ledger records are well under this limit. No additional locking needed.

3. **SIGTERM timing** (REQ-006, PROP-013): integration tests that assert on SIGTERM must
   give the process at least 500 ms after the signal before reading `ledger.jsonl`.

4. **Loop detect false positive** (REQ-005): if `LOOP_DETECT_WINDOW=0`, the guard must be
   disabled (treated as "never detect"). The config loader must clamp to minimum 1.
