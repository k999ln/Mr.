"""PROP-RL-LIVE2 scenarios 1+2: real compute_realized_gate + decide_promotion against
a disposable git clone (real git history) + the REAL live ledger.

Scenario 1: eligible candidate, disposable CLONE of /Users/operator/anicca (real git history,
including the real "feat(self-improve): promote candidate" commit), env=None so the REAL ledger
resolves via ledger_reader's own __file__-relative default -> real realized_gate assembled ->
fed into the REAL decide_promotion.

Scenario 2: genuinely trigger resolved=False (NOT a hand-built dict) by deleting the
ledger_reader module's own `__file__` global for the duration of one call (simulates the exotic
"cannot determine our own module __file__" packaging context REQ-RL1.3 guards against) -> the
REAL compute_realized_gate/decide_promotion functions run unmodified -> unconditional block.
