# Enable the daily DEV SELF-BUILD (consumer) schedule (spec §10 row 10f).
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS SHIPPED, NOT RUN, BY THE ATOMIC THAT ADDED IT. Loading a launchd job is a real,
# recurring side effect on Dais's machine; it happens once, deliberately, after the PR is merged.
# Nothing in the loop calls this file — the loop must never be able to schedule itself.
#
# TWO JOBS, TWO LABELS. Getting this wrong is how the loop eats itself:
#
#   ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-dev        PRODUCER. Runs scripts/rockstar_ibot-dev-d0.sh: reads a
#                                     self-heal issue, writes a fix, opens a PR. It never merges.
#                                     Currently PARKED (…​.plist.disabled). THIS SCRIPT NEVER
#                                     TOUCHES IT — not the plist, not the label, not launchctl.
#
#   ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-selfbuild  CONSUMER. Runs skills/rockstar_ibot/self-build-daily.sh: takes
#                                     the oldest eligible producer PR and hands it to the merge
#                                     guard. This is the job this script installs.
#
# An earlier version of this file wrote the CONSUMER into the PRODUCER's label. Enabling the
# consumer would have silently unscheduled the producer — the loop would have drained the existing
# backlog, found nothing new ever again, and reported seven honest no-op days as success. A consumer
# with no producer is a loop with no input; they are two jobs and they get two labels.
#
# The producer is NOT revived here. Whether it should run again is a decision with its own blast
# radius (it opens PRs and sends Telegram), so this script prints the exact command and stops.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. refuses unless the repo root is a real main checkout — on main, not a worktree, clean tree;
#   2. refuses unless the three files the job needs exist AT HEAD OF MAIN (git show, not the
#      working tree — the working tree can hold anything, including this branch);
#   3. refuses unless every binary the job needs resolves under the job's OWN environment
#      (`env -i PATH=…`), because a login shell's PATH is not launchd's;
#   4. writes the consumer plist under its own label, pinned to 04:10 with TZ=Asia/Tokyo;
#   5. bootstraps it and reads back what launchd actually thinks, rather than assuming.
#
# TIME ZONE. launchd StartCalendarInterval is LOCAL time with no time-zone field (Apple, "Creating
# Launch Daemons and Agents"). This machine runs Asia/Tokyo, so Hour=4 Minute=10 IS 04:10 JST. The
# script asserts the machine's zone rather than trusting it — and because a machine's zone can be
# changed six months from now, TZ is ALSO set in the plist and re-asserted by the entrypoint at run
# time, so the pass's own day math cannot drift even if the schedule does.
#
# Usage:  apps/rockstar_ibot/scripts/enable-self-build-launchd.sh          # enable + read back
#         apps/rockstar_ibot/scripts/enable-self-build-launchd.sh --status # read back only
