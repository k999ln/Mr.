//
// Contract, both directions:
//   IN  — the PR diff arrives on stdin. Nothing else. No repo access is assumed, no PR number, no
//         branch: the reviewer judges the diff it was handed and nothing it might have fetched.
//   OUT — one JSON object on stdout, `{"verdict":"pass"|"fail","findings":[...]}`, which is the
//         guard's contract (lowercase). The reviewer MODEL is asked for {"verdict":"PASS"|"FAIL"}
//         because upper case is what a model reliably emits; this script lowercases it.
//
// FAIL CLOSED, every time. Timeout, non-zero exit, prose instead of JSON, a missing verdict, a
// near-miss like "passed" — all of them are FAIL. The asymmetry is deliberate: a wrong FAIL costs
// one day of an unattended loop, a wrong PASS merges unreviewed code into production.
//
// THE DIFF IS HOSTILE INPUT. It is written by machinery, judged by a model, and merged by nobody —
// so a comment inside it addressed to the reviewer is a plausible attack, not a hypothetical. Two
// independent defences, because either alone is one bad day away from failing:
//   1. the prompt fences the diff and declares everything inside the fence untrusted DATA, makes an
//      attempt to steer the verdict a FAIL finding in itself, and forbids a verdict before the
//      findings are listed;
//   2. screenDiffForInjection refuses verdict-shaped and system-prompt-shaped diffs DETERMINISTICALLY,
//      before a model is spawned at all. No model judgement is involved, so no model can be talked
//      out of it.
//
// THE REVIEWER IS NOT AN OPERATOR. It is spawned with PATH and HOME and nothing else — no
// $GH_TOKEN, no $RAILWAY_TOKEN, no $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, no MCP servers, no tools, no settings. It
// reads a diff on stdin and writes JSON on stdout; anything more is capability it can be tricked
// into using.
//
// MODEL ROUTING IS THE OPERATOR'S SHELL'S BUSINESS. `claude` here is whatever `claude` resolves to
// in the environment launchd hands this process — the claudexmix/Sol proxy alias, or a direct
// Anthropic session. This file pins NO model and NO provider, so the loop keeps working when
// routing changes and fails loudly (FAIL, not silent pass) when the CLI is missing. Override the
// binary with $LM_DEV_REVIEW_CLI, the budget with $LM_DEV_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS.
//
// FRESHNESS is the point of `-p`: one non-interactive process per review, no resumed session, no
// memory of the implementation that produced the diff. A reviewer that helped write the code is not
// a reviewer.
//
// This file is not named dev-merge-guard*, so the guard's STATIC self-deny list does not cover it —
// but the guard resolves `--review-cmd` by realpath at runtime and refuses any PR that touches the
// resolved file, so a PR cannot edit its own judge. See lib/self-build-daily-runtime.test.js.
