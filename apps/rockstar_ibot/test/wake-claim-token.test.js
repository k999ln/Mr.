// spec 2026-08-01-lm-daily-organ-design.md §3 row 1c, §3.1 — claim ownership.
//
// WHY ITS OWN FILE. test/wake-miss-record.test.js is about the lm_wake_miss LEDGER (row 1b: a wake
// we owed and did not deliver leaves a reasoned trace), and it drives wakeUserOnce through injected
// deps. This file is about a different property — that a release can prove it owns the row it
// deletes — and two of its three cases have to reach the REAL claimWake/releaseWake, which talk to
// PostgREST directly and are stubbed at the fetch seam instead. Folding them into the miss ledger
// file would mix two harness styles and blur what each file pins.
//
// THE HARM BEING PREVENTED IS A SECOND PHONE CALL. forEachUserSafe's timeout does not abort the work
// it abandons, so a hung placeCall outlives its tick and its late releaseWake could delete a LATER
// tick's successful claim — after which the next tick re-claims and rings the user again. Dropping
// the wake budget from 90s to 20s made the abandonment ~4.5x more likely, so this got worse, not
// better. A duplicate call is user-visible harm, so the claim gets an identity rather than a
// narrower race window.
//
// Run: node --test test/wake-claim-token.test.js
