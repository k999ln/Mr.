// answers a detection with, driven through the REAL server.js over real HTTP.
//
// This is a status-code contract, and it can only be tested from the outside. The unit tests around
// applyAmdDetection already prove what gets written; none of them can see the one thing that decides
// whether a lost write is recoverable — the number we hand back to Telnyx. Telnyx reads any 2xx as
// "you have it now, I am done" and only redelivers when it does NOT get one
// (developers.telnyx.com/development/api-fundamentals/webhooks/receiving-webhooks: "All response
// codes outside this range... will indicate to Telnyx that you did not receive the webhook"; up to 3
// primary + 3 failover attempts with exponential backoff). So a 200 sent while Supabase is down is
// not a cosmetic mislabel: it is us destroying the only remaining copy of that detection.
//
// The fake fetch THROWS on any host or path it was not told about, so "the handler answered without
// reaching Supabase" cannot pass unnoticed — it would surface as an unexpected-fetch failure rather
// than as a green test.
