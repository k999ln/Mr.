// One daily self-build pass (spec §10 row 10f, §9.3 DEV loop).
//
// 10e built the merge guard: a PR goes in, an 8-stage pipeline decides, and a hash-chained row is
// appended to $LM_DEV_GUARD_LEDGER. What 10e deliberately did NOT build is the thing that decides
// WHICH PR to hand it, once a day, with nobody watching. That is this file.
//
// One pass, in order:
//
//   1. list the open error-fix PRs the loop itself produced — its own branch prefix AND its own
//      body marker, so a human's PR is never touched by unattended machinery;
//   2. run the guard's OWN eligibility check over them, dry — no merge, no deploy, no writes —
//      and pick the OLDEST that passes (oldest first, so a PR can never be starved by newer work);
//   3. run the merge guard end to end on that one PR, under a wall-clock budget;
//   4. append exactly one day row to $LM_SELFBUILD_LEDGER.
//
// A day with nothing to do still writes a row. So does a day that could not read the backlog at
// all. The spec's done condition is "各日 issue/PR/no-op 理由" — seven distinct days each carrying
// an honest outcome — so a silent day is indistinguishable from a dead loop, and a loop that skips
// its ledger on quiet days can claim any streak it likes.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MAY NOT DECIDE. It picks the candidate; it never decides the outcome. Every gate
// (review, blocked actions, tests, merge, deploy, rollback) lives in the guard, and the guard's own
// files are refused at eligibility, so a loop-authored PR cannot weaken them. This orchestrator and
// the reviewer it spawns are handed to the guard as `protectedPaths` for the same reason: a PR that
// rewrote the picker could point `--review-cmd` at a rubber stamp, and the guard would then dutifully
// protect the rubber stamp instead. SELF_BUILD_PROTECTED_PATHS closes that door — those three files
// change only through a human-merged PR.
//
// HOW THAT CLAIM IS ACTUALLY MADE TRUE, since a comment is not a mechanism: the paths are passed
// to `deps.runGuard`, which puts them on the guard CLI's argv as repeated `--protect <path>`, and
// the CLI unions them with the paths it resolves from `--review-cmd`. Until 2026-07-27 they were
// accepted here and silently dropped by the spawn, so this paragraph described nothing.
//
// TWO MORE THINGS THIS FILE PROMISES, both of them mechanisms rather than intentions:
//   * TOCTOU. The head oid the precheck judged travels to the guard as `--expect-head`, and the
//     guard refuses at stage one if the branch has been force-pushed since. Everything decided
//     here was decided about one specific commit.
//   * The budget never interrupts a merge. When the wall clock runs out, the guard's progress file
//     is consulted: pre-merge stages are killed, and a guard that has entered `merge` is waited
//     on to completion. A kill landing mid-merge would leave main changed, unrecorded and
//     un-rolled-back, which is worse than any overrun.
//
// This file contains no schedule wiring. Enabling launchd is an explicit operator step
// (scripts/enable-self-build-launchd.sh), never something the loop does to itself.
