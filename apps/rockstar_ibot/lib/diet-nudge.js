// H2 ORG-diet — the intervention (spec §10 NEXT HORIZON row H2 ③).
//
// This is the leg that can do real harm. An unsolicited message about what someone eats is a sermon
// unless three things are true at once, and every one of them is a hard gate here:
//
//   EVIDENCE  — at least 4 real answers in the trailing 14 days, and fast food at 50% or more of
//               them. Three samples is an anecdote; nudging on an anecdote is nagging with a
//               spreadsheet attached. 「食べてない」 counts in the DENOMINATOR: a day with no lunch
//               is an observation we made and it is honestly not fast food, which makes the nudge
//               harder to fire — the safe direction for a message nobody asked for.
//   TIMING    — 11:15-11:45 in the user's own clock, and at most ONCE A WEEK. Before lunch is
//               decided, not after: a message that arrives at 13:00 can only make someone feel bad
//               about a choice already made, which is the definition of moralising. The weekly
//               cadence is the anti-sermon bound — at three questions a week the 14-day evidence
//               barely moves between days, so a daily cap would license six near-identical messages
//               about the same four taps. Both bounds are read from the ledger, not from memory.
//   AN OPTION — one real place near the user, found via the SAME Places transport 11b uses
//               (care-candidate-search's textSearch/geocodeAnchor — no second hand-rolled client).
//               The message says WHICH anchor it searched: 「職場の近く」 is claimed only when a real
//               work anchor existed, and the home fallback says 「近くだと」 instead. When Places
//               finds nothing we SAY so (§9.5: honest failure beats fabricated success) rather than
//               shipping a bare opinion or swallowing the message.
//
// H2 ⑥ binds the copy as much as the code: no calories, no verdict, no 「健康」. The message states a
// count the user can check against their own memory and names one shop. It does not ask a question,
// so there is no reply to owe (§9.11 ④). What we think about their diet never appears, because we
// do not think anything about their diet — we counted taps.
//
// The clock is the user's own, resolved by the same honest chain the question leg uses, and a user
// whose zone we cannot resolve gets NOTHING (see diet-runtime's header).
