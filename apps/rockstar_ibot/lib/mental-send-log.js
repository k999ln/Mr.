// lm_mental_send_log — the MENTAL organ's send budget, shared.
//
// H4 (precepts) rides MENTAL's 3/day cap and 2h spacing rather than opening a second budget: from
// the user's side there is one stream of unsolicited evening messages, and two organs each politely
// keeping to "3 a day" is six a day. So the precepts ask and the weekly mirror READ this table before
// they speak and WRITE to it after they do — the kind rides in `trigger`, and the copy (not the
// table) is what makes a precepts message different from an affirmation.
//
// These two functions used to live inside scheduler.js where only mentalDeps could reach them.
// Nothing about them is scheduler-specific, and a budget that only one caller can see is not a
// budget.
//
// STRICTNESS IS PER-CALLER, ON PURPOSE:
//   * MENTAL (strict: false, the historical behaviour, unchanged) treats an unreadable log as
//     "nothing sent yet". That is wrong-but-shipped, and quietly tightening it here would change the
//     behaviour of a live organ in a branch that is supposed to be adding a different one.
//   * PRECEPTS (strict: true) THROWS instead, and its runtime turns the throw into a silence with a
//     once-per-day log line — the diet organ's `ledger-unreadable` rule. Treating an outage as an
//     empty history is precisely how a 3/day cap becomes unbounded during an incident, and precepts
//     is the organ that would be spending someone else's budget while doing it.
