"use strict";
// H4 ORG-precepts — the production leg of the observation (spec §10 NEXT HORIZON row H4 ①/②/④/⑤).
//
// precepts-question.js decides WHEN; this module is the only place the decision touches the world.
// It is the H2 diet organ's runtime with one addition — the MENTAL budget — and every problem H2
// solved is solved the same way here rather than a slightly different way:
//
//   CLAIM BEFORE SEND. It rides the same 60s tick as MENTAL/PHYSICAL/DIET, and the bedtime window is
//     30 minutes wide, so 30 ticks see "ask". The claim is an INSERT into lm_precepts_log guarded by
//     UNIQUE (uid, day, kind); the loser of the race gets a 409 and stops without sending. Honest
//     cost, stated rather than hidden: if Telegram then fails, the ask row stands (the ledger is
//     append-only, so we cannot take it back) and this week's slot is spent. That is the safe side —
//     a lost question costs one data point, a duplicated question costs the user's patience, and the
//     7-day spacing means the next attempt is a week out anyway.
//   WINDOW BEFORE READ. The bedtime window is checked before Supabase is touched: for 23½ of every
//     24 hours this organ must cost exactly nothing, and a read placed ahead of the clock check bills
//     the whole fleet 1440 times a day to learn what arithmetic already knew.
//   STRICT LEDGER READS + A LOG-ONCE LATCH. An unreadable history never becomes "never asked" —
//     that is how a weekly cap turns into a nightly one during an incident — but the 60s tick must
//     not narrate the same outage 30 times. One line per user per local day.
//   THE DAY AND THE CLOCK BOTH RIDE IN THE CALLBACK. A keyboard never expires on its own, so the tap
//     says which night it is about AND which UTC offset produced that night. The second half matters
//     because the two halves of this organ run in different processes with different views of the
//     schema: the scheduler joins lm_panel_preferences.call_time_zone onto the user row, while the
//     webhook's rowByChatId selects lm_users — which has no timezone column. A handler that
//     re-resolves the offset therefore judges "is this still tonight?" against a different midnight
//     than the ask used. The ask moment is the source of truth, so it ships its own answer.
//   WHOSE CLOCK. deps.tzOffsetH → the user row's own zone → LM_PRECEPTS_UTC_OFFSET_HOURS → NOTHING.
//     When the chain runs out the organ stays SILENT for that user and says so once per boot. A
//     default of JST would ask a Berlin user this question at 06:30.
//   FAIL CLOSED ON CAP ACCOUNTING. recordMentalSend is best-effort by contract (the message is
//     already delivered when it runs), so it can return false. That means the shared 3/day cap did
//     not see a send it should have seen. Rather than keep spending a budget we can no longer count,
//     both legs stand down for the rest of that local day and say `budgeted:false` out loud.
//
// AND THE ONE THING H2 DOES NOT DO — H4 ⑤, 別枠にしない. The ask is a MENTAL send: it reads
// lm_mental_send_log before deciding (3/day cap, 2h spacing) and writes to it after delivering. The
// user does not experience "the precepts organ" and "the mental organ"; they experience one stream of
// unsolicited evening messages, and two organs each politely keeping to three a day is six a day.
//
// The tap writes nothing but the choice. §10.0-15 ① is honoured by EDITING the question message —
// that edit IS the visible response, so no thank-you is sent. A follow-up on every tap would turn a
// once-a-week question into a conversation the user has to close.
