// H2 ORG-diet — the production leg of the observation (spec §10 NEXT HORIZON row H2 ①/②).
//
// diet-question.js decides WHEN; this module is the only place the decision touches the world. It
// rides the same 60s tick as MENTAL and PHYSICAL, which is exactly why the claim comes first: the
// lunch window is 120 minutes wide, so 120 ticks see "ask" and without a durable claim the user
// gets 120 identical questions. The claim is an INSERT into lm_diet_log guarded by
// UNIQUE (uid, day, kind) — the claimWake / lm_care_scan_log precedent, so a restart can neither
// double-ask nor forget.
//
// Claim-before-send has one honest cost, stated rather than hidden: if Telegram then fails, the ask
// row stands (the ledger is append-only, so we cannot take it back) and today's slot is spent. That
// is the safe side of the trade — a lost question costs one data point, a duplicated question costs
// the user's patience, and the 48h spacing means the next attempt is two days out anyway.
//
// Reading the ledger is STRICT: readDietAskState THROWS rather than returning "never asked", because
// treating an outage as an empty history is precisely how a weekly cap turns into a daily one during
// an incident. dietUserOnce catches that throw, reports `ledger-unreadable`, and LOGS IT ONCE per
// user per local day — a 60s tick would otherwise print the same Supabase error 120 times a window.
//
// WHOSE CLOCK. There is no timezone column on lm_users, and this branch does not invent one. The
// chain is: an explicit deps.tzOffsetH → the user row's own zone if the row carries one (scheduler
// merges lm_panel_preferences.call_time_zone, the only tz column that actually exists, onto the row)
// → LM_DIET_UTC_OFFSET_HOURS → NOTHING. When the chain runs out, the organ stays SILENT for that
// user and says so once per boot. A default of JST would ask a Berlin user at 04:30 and a Los
// Angeles user at 20:00; an unasked question costs one data point, a 3am question costs the trust
// that makes every other organ tolerable.
//
// The tap writes nothing but the choice. §10.0-15 ① is honoured by EDITING the question message —
// that edit IS the visible response, so no thank-you is sent. A follow-up message on every tap
// would make a once-every-48-hours question feel like a conversation the user has to close.
//
// LOCATION. deps.getLocationState is a real gate here and it is fed exactly the way MENTAL's is —
// scheduler passes the same injected provider through to both. In production today that provider
// does not exist, so BOTH organs read the constant "unknown": the gate is present and wired, not
// live. That is the sibling's honest state, and this file claims no more than the sibling has.
