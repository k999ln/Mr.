// 11a runtime: care detection needs the user's OWN visit HISTORY. fetchUpcomingEvents is
// future-only by contract (and rightly so — every wake/late consumer depends on it), which is the
// same unreachable-rule disease 12c had: the one thing the care detector needs (past visits) is the
// one thing that fetch can never return. This is a dedicated history read with its own contract
// (mirrors the lookbackMs precedent above rather than stretching the wake reader to ten years):
//   - window = [now - historyMs, now], default ~10 years. Long-period checkups need four real
//     visits before the existing cadence guard may act; a biennial cadence plus the 1.5× overdue
//     threshold needs roughly nine years of evidence at action time.
//   - all-day (date-only) events are KEPT — a barber visit logged all-day is still a visit
//   - no interpretCalendarEvent filter — "no_call" is a call decision, not a history decision
//   - the raw `start` object survives so detectCalendarCare can parse dateTime/date itself
//   - endMs is reported when the source has end.dateTime, and NULL otherwise (all-day rows, or an
//     end the provider could not give). Null means "unknown", never "zero" and never a guess: a
//     consumer that needs a duration owns and documents its own assumption.
//   - STRICT reads: a transport/API failure PROPAGATES (throws) instead of returning []. The wake
//     path's swallow-to-[] is load-bearing there, but here the caller (careUserOnce) persists an
//     append-only once-per-day claim — "the read failed" must never look like "empty calendar",
//     or a single API blip freezes a fabricated empty scan for the whole day.
//   - PROVABLY COMPLETE window: the read follows the transport's page cursor until it is exhausted.
//     The previous shape split the window into ≤3 blind ~183-day chunks and ASSUMED no chunk held
//     more than maxResults events — a guess, not a proof — while throwing Google's nextPageToken
//     away, so a busier calendar would have frozen a silently truncated history into the append-only
//     lm_care_scan_log as if it were the whole truth. Truncation is now impossible to mistake for
//     completeness, in both directions:
//       * cursor exhausted  → the history is complete, by construction
//       * cursor still live at HISTORY_MAX_EVENTS, or a cursor-less transport hands back a FULL page
//         with nothing to follow → THROW. careUserOnce turns that into status:"history_unavailable"
//         (no row, no daily claim, the next 60s tick retries), which is the honest answer: an
//         incomplete history is a failed read wearing a success mask, and detectUnmetCare reads
//         gaps — every event it never saw invents overdue days that did not happen.
