// with no clock, no I/O and no env, so every reason to stay silent is testable and none of them can
// be quietly skipped. As with H2, the silences are the product.
//
// This question is the most intrusive thing the product asks, so it is bounded harder than any other
// organ's:
//   ONCE A WEEK. Seven days from the last ask, read from the ledger rather than from memory. A daily
//     version of this question is a daily invitation to feel bad, which is the opposite of what
//     noticing is for.
//   INSIDE MENTAL'S BUDGET (H4 ⑤ — 別枠にしない). The user sees one stream of unsolicited evening
//     messages; two organs each keeping politely to "3 a day" is six a day. So the 3/day cap and the
//     2h spacing here are MENTAL's own constants, imported, not re-declared.
//   THE 30 MINUTES BEFORE THE USER'S OWN BEDTIME. Not a fixed hour — the same pre_sleep target
//     mental-runtime already resolves, in the user's own clock. Note the deliberate overlap with
//     MENTAL's pre_sleep window (15-60 min before the same target): if an affirmation went out
//     there, the 2h spacing above suppresses this question, so the two can never stack.
//
// H4 ③ binds this file too: nothing here classifies, scores or diagnoses. It decides WHEN to ask.
// What the answer means is the ledger's business, and what it says about the person is nobody's.

// lm_panel_preferences.call_time_zone onto the user row; the tap runs in the webhook, whose
// rowByChatId selects lm_users only — a table with no timezone column at all. The handler therefore
// cannot re-derive the clock the ask used: it would fall back to LM_PRECEPTS_UTC_OFFSET_HOURS (or to
// nothing) and judge "is this still tonight's question?" against a different midnight than the one
