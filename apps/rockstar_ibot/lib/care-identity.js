// lib/care-identity.js — §10.1 U8: how Rockstar_ibot names itself to the outside world.
//
// 「Rockstar_ibot（AI secretary, acting for <user>）」— the delegation is stated in the identification
// ITSELF, so a provider reading a booking form or an email knows, in the first thing they read, that
// they are dealing with an agent acting for a named person. U8's rule is 本人を装わない: we never type
// the user's bare name into a free-text field as though the user typed it.
//
// This lives in its own module because both the 11c web-form executor and the (still unimplemented)
// email route must use the SAME string. Two copies would eventually disagree, and the one that
// drifted would be the one that impersonated someone.
