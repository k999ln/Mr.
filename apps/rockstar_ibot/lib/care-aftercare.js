// lib/care-aftercare.js — 11d: what happens AFTER 11c tries to book.
//
// §9.5 REPORT, DON'T ASK: the user is told what was done, not asked for permission. That cuts both
// ways — a booking that happened is reported as a booking (§9.11 PHYSICAL copy, verbatim from
// lib/i18n.js), and a booking that did NOT happen is reported as a failure with the real candidates
// attached, never as silence and never as a hedged half-success.
//
// Three outcomes, three different shapes, and the difference between them is the whole point:
//
//   booked          → §9.11 事後報告 + a real calendar event + the booking on the scan row. The
//                     sentence 「カレンダーに入れてあります」 is rendered from the RESULT of that
//                     write, never alongside it: no calendar, a refused write, or a slot with no
//                     timezone all produce the sentence that says the entry could not be made.
//   possibly_booked → an honest "I could not confirm it, and I did not resend" message.
//                     NO calendar event: writing 木曜18:00 into someone's calendar off an
//                     unconfirmed submit is exactly the fabricated success 11d was blocked on before.
//   honest_failure  → §9.5's 候補提示 + 正直報告: why I could not book, and the real candidates 11b
//                     found so the user can finish it in one tap of their own.
//
// The record is written for ALL THREE, even when the user is unreachable and even when the send
// fails — the scan row is the audit trail, and an attempt that left no trace is indistinguishable
// from an attempt that never happened. It nests under `chain.booking` because lm_care_scan_log's
// append-only trigger permits exactly two columns to be filled in after insert: chain, chain_error.

// the hour the user reads in the message and the hour sitting in their calendar disagree by the
// server's offset. Nine hours off is not a rounding error, it is a different appointment. No offset →
// no calendar write, and the report says the entry could not be made.
