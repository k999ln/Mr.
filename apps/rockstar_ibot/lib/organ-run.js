// Every organ in the tick was already try/catch-wrapped, so a THROW could not kill its siblings.
// Nothing measured how LONG one took, which is the failure that actually happened: organs share one
// per-user budget, and `tenant timeout 90000ms` named the user but never the organ that ate it.
// runOrgan is that missing measurement, and it keeps the existing swallow-and-continue contract.

  // `log`/`logError` default rather than being required: this wrapper's entire job is to never take
  // down its caller, and a missing logger would otherwise throw from the catch block and propagate —
  // the exact failure the wrapper exists to prevent.
  //
  // A FAILURE GOES TO stderr, A SUCCESS DOES NOT. Every organ's own catch block used console.error
  // before this wrapper existed; routing both outcomes through one `log` quietly demoted organ
  // failures to stdout, so anything watching stderr saw nothing when an organ broke. Measuring how
  // long an organ took must not cost the ability to notice that it died.
