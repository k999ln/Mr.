# rockstar_ibot — OpenClaw Skill

Rockstar_ibot keeps you on time. It reads your Google Calendar, resolves where you need to be,
figures out when you must leave, and calls your phone before you have to go.

## What it does

For every upcoming event the agent autonomously decides:

- **Online / phone call** — no travel needed. It recognises this from the event summary and
  location (e.g. "Zoom", "電話", a URL). No action beyond the wake call at the right time.
- **Physical venue** — it looks up travel time from your current location (or wherever you just
  were) using Google Maps, then inserts a `[Travel]` calendar block so the wake call fires before
  you need to leave, not just before the event starts.
- **Unknown location** — if it cannot figure out where to go it asks you via your connected
  channel (Telegram if linked, otherwise Gmail). It reads your reply and fills in the location
  automatically, then proceeds with travel planning.

The judgment — online vs findable venue vs genuinely unknown — lives in `lib/ask.js` and is made
by the model, not by hardcoded rules. A few canonical examples guide it; edge cases are handled
by the agent.

## Cron entrypoints

Three one-shot scripts replace the `setInterval` loops that run inside Railway. The OpenClaw
gateway calls each script on its own schedule and manages the interval.

| Script | Function | Suggested cadence |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/tick.js` | Wake-call pass — places T-15/10/5 Telnyx+Gemini calls for events due now | Every 60 s |
| `scripts/travel.js` | Travel-fill pass — inserts `[Travel]` blocks for the next 7 days | Every 30 min |
| `scripts/ask.js` | Ask/reply pass — asks users about missing locations, reads replies | Every 20 min |

Each script:
1. Loads env vars from the OpenClaw gateway (no `.env` file needed at runtime).
2. Calls the corresponding one-shot function from `../../scheduler.js`.
3. Exits 0 on success, exits 1 on error (logged to stderr so the gateway sees it).

## Required env vars

Supplied by the OpenClaw gateway. The scripts themselves read nothing directly — `scheduler.js`
pulls these from `process.env` internally.

| Var | Used by |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | All passes (voice bridge + agentic location resolve) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | User registry + wake dedup log |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` | Calendar read/write (Google Calendar via Composio) |
| `LIFE_MAPS_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) | Travel time + Places lookup |
| `PUBLIC_WSS` | tick only — WebSocket URL for the Telnyx/Gemini bridge |
| `LM_CALL_SECRET` | tick only — HMAC secret that authenticates the bridge upgrade |
| `LM_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | ask only — send/read Telegram messages |
| `UNIPILE_TOKEN` + `UNIPILE_DSN` | ask only — send/read Gmail via Unipile |

## Architecture notes

- **Pure core** (`lib/travel.js`, `lib/wake-filter.js`, `lib/events.js`) — deterministic
  geometry and calendar logic, fully tested, no side effects.
- **Effectful shell** (`lib/dial.js`, `lib/ask.js`, `scheduler.js`) — Telnyx calls, Gemini
  voice, Supabase writes. Tested via stubs.
- **This skill** (`skill-rockstar_ibot/scripts/`) — thin cron entrypoints only. No logic lives
  here; everything is delegated to `scheduler.js`.
- **Voice daemon** (B3) — `server.js` run with `LIFE_RUN_LOOPS=false` is an always-on process that
  serves ONLY the `/ws` Telnyx⇄Gemini-Live voice bridge (Charon) + `/test-call` + `/telegram` endpoints;
  it does NOT run the scheduler loops (the OpenClaw cron jobs own those — single writer). Run it as a
  launchd KeepAlive daemon or a 2nd always-on service:
  `LIFE_RUN_LOOPS=false GEMINI_API_KEY=… node server.js`. Default (flag unset) keeps the in-process
  loops ON, so the standalone Railway app is unchanged.

The Railway Node app (`server.js` + `scheduler.js`) and the cron/Inngest adapters share the same
per-user functions; no business logic is duplicated in the adapters. `LIFE_RUN_LOOPS` selects one
scheduler owner at a time. WAKE, TRAVEL, and ASK also use the atomic claims introduced by
`migrations/2026-06-24-ch1-atomic-dedup.sql`. With the canonical Supabase schema configured, those
claims fence effects during an overlapping transition. Keep the owner switch because it avoids
wasted polling and remains the fail-safe when Supabase is unavailable.
