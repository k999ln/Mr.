# One command to run Rockstar_ibot on your own machine.
#
#   git clone https://github.com/k999ln/Mr..git rockstar_ibot && cd rockstar_ibot
#   ./scripts/local-up.sh
#
# It creates the local env file if you don't have one (generating a password for the
# local object store rather than shipping a real one), brings up the compose stack, and
# waits until every service reports healthy before telling you it worked. A stack that
# is "up" but not healthy is the failure this script exists to catch -- printing URLs the
# moment `compose up` returns would report success before anything can serve a request.
#
# Subcommands: up (default) | down | status | logs
#
# Overrides, mainly for testing an isolated copy next to a running one:
#   LM_LOCAL_PROJECT   compose project name       (default: rockstar_ibot-local)
#   LM_LOCAL_API_PORT / LM_LOCAL_WORKER_HEALTH_PORT / LM_LOCAL_MINIO_PORT / LM_LOCAL_MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT
#   LM_LOCAL_NO_BUILD=1  reuse the existing runtime image instead of rebuilding
