# supervisor restarts this script whenever it exits, so Anicca stands on its own — no human runs it
# by hand. On every (re)start it:
#   1. SELF-UPDATES: git pull the mother repo so this body always runs the latest motherboard.
#   2. ensures its own brain is up — the shared free-tier LLM router (Base/EVM self-pay, or a
#      readiness-probe-only wait for Franklin — see franklin-loop-revival REQ-004/§ENGINE-PARITY).
#   3. ensures its telemetry poster is up (reports to the dashboard).
#   4. exec's the ReAct loop in the FOREGROUND — when the loop exits, this script exits, and the
#      supervisor brings the whole body back (freshly updated).

# ANICCA_INSTANCE selects the brain+telemetry backend (§ENGINE-PARITY-FRANKLIN 2026-07-05, THINK
# routing fixed by franklin-loop-revival REQ-004 2026-07-08): default (unset or 'clawrouter') = the
# original EVM/Base ClawRouter + telemetry-poster.mjs path, UNCHANGED. 'franklin' = Franklin's OWN
# Solana wallet (~/.blockrun/.solana-session, resolved via resolve-identity.mjs, never touched
# here) for balance/tier purposes, but THINK now reaches the SAME shared :8402 LLM router as every
# other instance (Franklin no longer runs its own dedicated proxy binary) + the ed25519
# telemetry-post-franklin.mjs poster (one-shot script, looped here since it has no built-in interval).
#
# The loop itself is already crash-resilient (while-true + per-wake try/catch); this wrapper adds
# OS-level persistence (survives reboots/logout) and keeps every Anicca in sync with the mother.
