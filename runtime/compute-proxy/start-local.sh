# anicca local-default compute proxy — fully local, free, no server/API key.
#
# Anicca pays its OWN compute via ClawRouter/BlockRun (USDC x402) from its OWN
# wallet — exactly like Franklin. The user provides only SHELTER (this device);
# Anicca buys its own FOOD (inference). Free NVIDIA models when the wallet is
# empty; frontier models unlock automatically once USDC lands in the wallet.
#
# What this script DOES (and does NOT) do:
#   1. ensures a self-owned wallet at ~/.automaton/wallet.json (auto-gen, never a human key)
#   2. starts runtime/compute-proxy/proxy.mjs on :8402 (x402 self-pay, OpenAI-compatible)
#   3. exports OPENAI_BASE_URL + OPENAI_API_KEY (placeholder) + ANICCA_MODEL so an
#      OpenAI-compatible loop you pass in routes inference through the self-paid proxy
#   4. exec "$@" if you give it a loop command; otherwise HOLD the proxy in the
#      foreground and PRINT how to plug your loop in.
#
# Anicca SHIPS its loop at runtime/loop/index.mjs. Pass it as the loop command:
#   ./start-local.sh node runtime/loop/index.mjs
# With NO args this script only holds the self-pay proxy in the foreground and
# prints how to start the loop. Any OpenAI-compatible loop that reads
# OPENAI_BASE_URL / OPENAI_API_KEY (or ANICCA_MODEL) routes through the proxy.
