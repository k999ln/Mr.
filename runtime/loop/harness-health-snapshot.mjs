/**
 * harness-health-snapshot.mjs — Impure: CLI, the ONLY caller of computeHarnessHealth against real
 * disk state.
 *
 * anicca-harness-tooluse-health R7: reads $ANICCA_HOME/state/ledger.jsonl via the EXISTING
 * readLedgerLines, computes R4's computeHarnessHealth, and OVERWRITES (never appends — a derived
 * VIEW, not an event log) $ANICCA_HOME/state/harness-health.json with the result. A missing/
 * unreadable ledger.jsonl produces the R4 empty-ledger shape, never crashes.
 *
 * Scheduling (launchd/cron cadence) is explicitly deferred, same precedent
 * skills/self/healthcheck-runtime-loop.sh's own header comment already states for itself.
 *
 * Run via: node runtime/loop/harness-health-snapshot.mjs
 * Optional test-injection env var (same idiom as ANICCA_BALANCE_OVERRIDE/CLAUDE_BIN elsewhere in
 * this codebase): HARNESS_HEALTH_NOW — epoch-ms override for generatedAt, so a test can pin the
 * exact instant this script's output is compared against a direct computeHarnessHealth() call.
 * HARNESS_HEALTH_STREAK_THRESHOLD is read by harness-health.mjs itself (DEFAULT_STREAK_THRESHOLD).
