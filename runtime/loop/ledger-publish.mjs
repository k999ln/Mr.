/**
 * ledger-publish.mjs — Effectful (+ pure core): per-wake, best-effort commit+push of BOTH this
 * instance's ledger evidence sources into an explicitly configured repository, so "the balance/actions grow
 * every hour" is third-party-verifiable from git history alone -- WITHOUT ever touching the git
 * working tree/index/branches the loop itself (or a sibling process such as evolve.mjs's promote())
 * is concurrently using.
 *
 * franklin-ledger-push (P2) — spec: .vcsdd/features/franklin-ledger-push/specs/behavioral-spec.md
 * (REQ-701..710).
 *
 * impl-review iter3 fixes (this revision, FIND-001..003 — new numbering, distinct findings from
 * iter2's own FIND-001..006 documented further below):
 *
 *   FIND-001 (critical): `projectEarnField()`'s earn allowlist dropped `external`/`confirmed`/
 *   `fill_tid` entirely. `skills/_shared/lib/ledger.mjs::isProfitable()` — the repo's SINGLE source
 *   of truth for "is this earn-ledger line a real, GATE-0 profitable wake" — requires
 *   `external===true` unconditionally plus a chain-correct confirmation (`tx`+`status==='0x1'` for
 *   EVM, `sig`+`confirmed===true` for Solana, `fill_tid`+`confirmed===true` for Hyperliquid). Without
 *   these three fields, `isProfitable()` returns `false` for EVERY published earn line regardless of
 *   the source line's real profitability, so a third party cloning the branch could see dollar
 *   amounts but never run the project's own classifier against them. Fixed: `external`/`confirmed`
 *   (boolean-typed) and `fill_tid` (a settled Hyperliquid fill id — a finite number, or a bounded
 *   identifier-shaped string) are now preserved, type/shape-checked, never routed through
 *   free-text redaction (they are structured settlement references, not secrets).
 *
 *   FIND-002 (major): in the push-rejection retry branch, `pushed = true` was set unconditionally
 *   after the retry's try block, even on the path where the post-reset reconcile found nothing
 *   pending and NO `git push` was actually re-issued — misreporting a push as confirmed (and
 *   advancing `lastPushTs`/resetting `publishFailureStreak`) when no push call ran in that branch.
 *   Fixed: `pushed = true` now only executes immediately after the retry's own `git push` call, inside
 *   the `if (result.pendingLineCount > 0)` guard.
 *
 *   FIND-003: `sig` (Solana tx signature) previously only got a bare length/type check
 *   (`1 <= length <= 200`), not real shape validation — unlike `tx`'s hash-shape regex. Fixed: `sig`
 *   is now validated against the same base58, 64-88-char shape `record-swap.mjs` actually writes
 *   (`SIG_VALUE`), giving it the same shape-validation discipline REQ-706 already claimed it had.
 *
 * impl-review iter2 fixes (prior revision, FIND-001..006):
 *
 *   FIND-001 (money evidence never published): the ORIGINAL design read only `state/ledger.jsonl`
 *   (per-wake bookkeeping — kind/slot/exit_code, never a dollar amount). The actual money fields
 *   (`net_usdc`/`earn_usdc`/`cost_usdc`/`tx`/`sig`/`status`/`chain`) live EXCLUSIVELY in a separate
 *   file, `skills/earn/state/earn-ledger.jsonl` (written by skills/earn/lib/record.mjs via
 *   skills/_shared/lib/ledger.mjs::deriveLine, e.g. skills/earn/sol-trade/lib/record-swap.mjs:48-55).
 *   This revision publishes BOTH sources onto the SAME per-instance branch as two separate files —
 *   `<instance>-wake.jsonl` (from `state/ledger.jsonl`) and `<instance>-earn.jsonl` (from
 *   `skills/earn/state/earn-ledger.jsonl`) — each with its own field allowlist and its own
 *   independently-reconciled cursor (SOURCES registry below).
 *
 *   FIND-002 (silent gap: a lost/recreated publish-repo directory produces a CLEAN fast-forward
 *   push, never a rejection, so the old design's rejection-only recovery never fired and the marker
 *   falsely claimed the lost lines were pushed): this revision NEVER trusts the marker's cached
 *   `pushedLineCount` as ground truth. Every cycle, AFTER ensurePublishRepo() syncs the dedicated
 *   clone's working tree to origin's REAL current tip (`checkout -B branch origin/branch`, or a
 *   guaranteed-empty state pre-first-push — see ensurePublishRepo's own doc comment), the ACTUAL
 *   line count of the just-synced destination file IS this cycle's `pushedLineCount` for that
 *   source — unconditionally (reconcileSource()). This single reconciliation simultaneously covers
 *   both directions the spec's REQ-709 describes: a cached value that was too HIGH (commits actually
 *   lost, e.g. the publish-repo directory was deleted/recreated between cycles) is healed DOWNWARD to
 *   the real count; a cached value that was too LOW (the marker itself was lost/reset while origin
 *   already had more content) is adopted UPWARD to the real count. The marker is now purely a cache
 *   for decidePublish()'s timing math — never the source of truth for "what's actually on origin".
 *   To make "actual published line count" a valid proxy for "source lines processed" at all, every
 *   processed source line ALWAYS produces exactly one destination line (a `{}` placeholder for a
 *   malformed/non-object source line, never a silent drop from the position sequence) — this 1:1
 *   index alignment is what makes reconcileSource()'s line-count reconciliation sound.
 *
 *   FIND-003 (unrealistic divergence trigger): the reachable, realistic trigger for this class of bug
 *   in THIS single-writer-per-branch topology (REQ-705) is publishRepoDir loss/recreation between
 *   cycles, not an outside writer colliding on the same exclusive branch. The test suite now proves
 *   recovery against the REAL trigger: delete publishRepoDir entirely between two cycles and assert
 *   every source line still ends up on the branch exactly once.
 *
 *   FIND-004 (fabricated precedent citation): the only real sibling lock precedent in this repo is
 *   `skills/self/claude-p-mainloop.sh`'s PIDFILE guard (its own header explicitly says "NOT flock").
 *   `scripts/disk-cleaner.sh` does not exist anywhere in this repository — that citation is removed.
 *
 *   FIND-005 (no escalation, no reachability check): publishLedgerCycle() now tracks
 *   `publishFailureStreak` in the marker — incremented on a setup failure or a push-attempt failure
 *   (both the primary attempt and its one re-sync retry), reset to 0 the moment ensurePublishRepo()
 *   itself succeeds (proof the auth/clone/fetch/checkout path is healthy this cycle, independent of
 *   whether there was anything new to push). The streak is returned to the caller
 *   (`publishFailureStreak`); index.mjs's wiring escalates via the EXISTING appendHarnessFailure
 *   mechanism once it reaches 5 consecutive failures (kind: 'ledger_publish_stuck'), so a stuck
 *   pipeline (e.g. a revoked/read-only git credential) surfaces to healthchecks instead of failing
 *   silently on stderr forever. A ONE-TIME, non-fatal `git ls-remote` reachability probe runs right
 *   before the FIRST-EVER dedicated-clone setup (ensurePublishRepo's own "setup" phase) and logs
 *   clearly (no secrets — the origin URL for this repo carries no embedded token, auth is via the
 *   host-global `gh auth git-credential` helper) if it fails.
 *
 *   FIND-006 (unbounded full-history clone): the dedicated clone is now `--depth 1 --single-branch
 *   --no-tags`; every subsequent fetch of the per-instance branch uses an explicit `src:dst` refspec
 *   (`+refs/heads/<branch>:refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`) WITH `--depth 1 --no-tags` too, so the
 *   remote-tracking ref for a branch outside the clone's default single-branch config is still
 *   reliably created/updated (explicit refspecs always do this regardless of the configured default
 *   fetch refspec), and the clone never silently deepens/unshallows across cycles.
 *
 * Pure core (no I/O, directly unit-testable):
 *   - decidePublish()             — REQ-704 push throttle decision.
 *   - extractWakeId()/extractEarnRef() — parse a source line's own id field for the commit message.
 *   - projectWakeLine()/projectEarnLine() — per-source field-allowlist projection (FIND-001/003):
 *     parses one raw source line and returns ONLY an explicit allowlist of known-safe fields,
 *     type-checked; every other field (including the model-authored `args` object) is DROPPED,
 *     fail-closed. Free-text fields are redacted (see below) and capped at 200 chars. Malformed/
 *     non-object JSON -> null (the ORCHESTRATOR substitutes a `{}` placeholder for it — see FIND-002
 *     above — the pure function itself keeps its "never publish raw garbage" contract).
 *   - redactBroaderSecretPatterns() — a second, STRICTER redaction pass applied only to the
 *     free-text fields the projections allow through (`result`/`skip_reason` for wake, `task` for
 *     earn) -- covers base58 64-88 char runs (Solana secret-key shape) and generic 40+ hex char runs
 *     (a stricter bar than env-filter.mjs's own 64-hex-only contract, deliberately: content bound for
 *     a PUBLIC git branch gets a higher redaction floor than content that only ever stays local).
 *   - Reused: redactPrivateKeyPatterns (env-filter.mjs, unmodified).
 *
 * Effectful shell:
 *   - readMarker/writeMarker      — throttle/cursor state at $ANICCA_HOME/state/.ledger-publish-marker
 *     (now `{ wake: {pushedLineCount}, earn: {pushedLineCount}, lastPushTs, publishFailureStreak }`).
 *   - readLinesOrEmpty/appendRawLines — jsonl read (source or destination file), fs append.
 *   - acquireLock/releaseLock     — REQ-708 same-instance-overlap guard: an mkdir-atomic lock at
 *     $ANICCA_HOME/state/.ledger-publish-<instance>.lock with pid-staleness reclaim, copied from this
 *     repo's own established idiom — skills/self/claude-p-mainloop.sh's pidfile guard (FIND-004).
 *   - ensurePublishRepo           — REQ-705 (FIND-001/002/006): idempotently sets up the DEDICATED,
 *     shallow clone at `publishRepoDir`, synced to (or freshly, deterministically empty-orphan for)
 *     `ledger-<instance>`. Every git call in this function runs with cwd=publishRepoDir — repoRoot is
 *     passed nowhere near it.
 *   - reconcileSource             — FIND-002: derives this cycle's ground-truth `pushedLineCount` for
 *     ONE source directly from the just-synced destination file's actual line count, never the marker.
 *   - defaultGit                  — child_process wrapper (injectable via opts.git for tests).
 *   - publishLedgerCycle          — the orchestrator; the ONLY function index.mjs calls.
 *
 * REQ-703 (non-fatality) is enforced at multiple layers: every individual git call is wrapped in its
 * own try/catch with a specific `reason`, the lock is released in a `finally`, and the whole function
 * body is wrapped in an outermost try/catch so publishLedgerCycle() can never throw/reject under any
 * input, ever.
