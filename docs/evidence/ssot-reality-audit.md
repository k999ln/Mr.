# Rockstar_ibot SSOT reality audit

## Measured state

- GitHub `origin/main` is `a1f3123d3afc8a69702a64aa7d74999e362b11a7`.
- The launchd target checkout `/Users/operator/Projects/rockstar_ibot-main` was
  `608d84ea27bc2fdd88d167928296216046dce4e5`, ten commits behind `origin/main`. It is
  fast-forwarded to exact `a1f3123d3afc8a69702a64aa7d74999e362b11a7`.
- `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-dev` has two completed launchd runs and last exit code `0`.
- The append-only dev ledger contains two distinct real days. Its latest row is
  `outcome=no_op`, `reason=no_unattempted_open_issue`, duration `2998ms`.
- Marketing self-improve has one row only, for the old A03 public creative. It predates the new
  preview-first acceptance and does not count toward the approved 7-day streak.
- The marketing launchd was loaded for 10:15 with run count `0`. It is unloaded before that
  schedule fires, preventing another unapproved post.

## Status corrections

- 9b remains done: the MPT renderer and decoded MP4 artifacts are real.
- 9c reopens: the old public posts skipped the required bootstrap preview and approval.
- 9d remains pending and restarts at approved Day 0/7 without deleting the old baseline row.
- 9e becomes done by scope correction: Postiz remains canonical; direct TikTok migration stops.
- 10f advances from real Day 1/7 to real Day 2/7.
- 11a, 11b, and 11c reopen because the old chain does not prove a meaningful care category,
  matching provider service, and cloud execution.
- 11d remains pending on a real confirmed booking.

## Safety

No social post, provider booking, email, Calendar event, call, database row, or wallet mutation is
created by this audit. The only runtime mutation is the reversible unload of the marketing
launchd job to enforce the preview gate.
