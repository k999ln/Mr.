# DEV loop paused until final phase

## Verified runtime state

- launchd label `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-dev`: unloaded
- `rockstar_ibot-dev-daily.js` process count: zero
- active plist: absent
- disabled plist:
  `/Users/operator/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-dev.plist.disabled`
- pause marker:
  `/Users/operator/.openclaw/state/rockstar_ibot-dev/PAUSED_UNTIL_FINAL_PHASE`
- preserved append-only progress: real Day 2/7

## Resume boundary

Do not resume while any non-DEV item in §10 remains pending. Final phase order is:

1. 10e safe auto-merge/deploy
2. 10f daily self-build, then five additional distinct real days

When the boundary is satisfied, remove the pause marker, restore the `.plist` suffix, bootstrap
the LaunchAgent, and verify label loaded, process bounded, last exit, and new ledger row. Merely
loading the plist is not completion evidence.
