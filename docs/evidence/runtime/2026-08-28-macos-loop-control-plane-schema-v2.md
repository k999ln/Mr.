# macOS Loop Control Plane — TODO 2 schema v2

`config/loop-registry.json` is upgraded to schema v2 and contains all 169
installed, loaded, classified Rockstar_ibot jobs. The registry preserves the
pre-existing stable IDs `x-repost` and `x-tweeter`; other IDs are stable
label-derived identifiers. No launchd lifecycle command is executed in this
slice.

| Contract | Readback |
|---|---:|
| Registry entries / unique labels | 169 / 169 |
| Explicit external labels | 1 (`ai.anicca.tsbridge`) |
| Explicit retired labels | 2 (`ai.anicca.cfo-daily`, `ai.anicca.sync-memory`) |
| Domain | growth 49, earn 42, system 40, financial 32, physical 5, mental 1 |
| Effect | none 109, publish 31, message 13, application 9, money 6, trade 1 |
| Provider route | deterministic 90, shared-agent-runner 79 |
| Structurally invalid entries | 0 |
| Active classified inventory labels absent from registry | 0 |
| Registry labels absent from active classified inventory | 0 |

`runtime.loop.macos_loop_registry.validate_registry` rejects missing, unknown,
secret-like, absolute-path, invalid cadence, invalid cleanup, duplicate-label,
domain, effect, and provider-route values. Rendering sorts by loop ID and emits
canonical JSON bytes. The checked fixture is
`runtime/loop/tests/fixtures/macos-loop-jobs.json`, SHA-256
`35e3b1ae25ed87a815772b14c00c4a87e7e38a87e125bba98f1c04661b9b6c49`.

The focused suite runs four tests: missing/secret rejection, insertion-order
stability, exact active-label coverage plus safety-critical classifications,
and production fixture byte equality.

## Fail-closed migration boundary

All 169 registry entrypoints are present and executable at the current commit.
Migration remains fail-closed on complete release/apply validation;
not an executable compatibility shim. `apply` must reject any generation with
a missing entrypoint; TODO 9 must copy and verify exact behavior before each
affected label migrates. Until then the existing loaded job remains untouched.

The existing CEO budget gate still knows how to enumerate schema-v2 loop IDs,
but its historical hard-breach writer can add an `allocation` field that schema
v2 rejects. `apply` must therefore remain unavailable until mutable allocation
state is separated from the immutable registry and the enforcement reader is
updated. No such mutation occurs in this slice.
