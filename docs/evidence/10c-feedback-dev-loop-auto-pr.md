# 10c feedback to merged developer-loop PR evidence

## Result

- Real privacy-safe feedback chain: Telegram message `3922` → production DB row `1` → GitHub issue [#1085](https://github.com/Daisuke134/life-manager/issues/1085) → launchd D0 → PR [#1087](https://github.com/Daisuke134/life-manager/pull/1087).
- The fresh implementation agent adds regression coverage and changes the missing-calendar action label from `Connect calendar` to the requested exact `Connect Calendar` in both the control-center model and emitted panel UI.
- Fresh agent commit: `9c93bf367618db9965882c1ceb89c4f6303e46d9`.
- D0 append-only state records issue `1085`, PR `1087`, status `pr_open`.
- Real D0 Telegram report returns message id `3386`.
- PR #1087 is the auto-created PR and the same PR carrying this evidence and §10 update. Its GitHub merge readback is the final post-merge containment check.

## Corrective TDD

The first launchd run exposes a false-green in the inherited runner invocation: the required `--loop` argument is absent, so the fresh agent exits `2`; tests pass only on the D0 infrastructure diff and PR #1087 initially contains no UI fix. It is not merged.

A new failing runtime contract requires:

- canonical `Daisuke134/life-manager`, `origin/main`, and `apps/rockstar_ibot` only;
- runner loop identity;
- nonzero fresh-agent exit to stop before tests or PR creation;
- full app tests and every eval before PR creation;
- no merge command in D0.

Corrective GREEN is `3/3`, and the second launchd run records fresh-agent exit `0`. The agent's focused panel batch passes `51/51` plus the existing FIND-008 case. D0 independently runs full `npm test`, all seven eval suites at 100%, and panel privacy before updating PR #1087.

## Live readback

| Surface | Readback |
|---|---|
| launchd | `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-dev`, run count `1→2`, last exit `0` |
| Issue | #1085 open and selected by exact `lm:type:self-heal` contract |
| Fresh agent | exit `0`, result status `ok`, commit `9c93bf36…` |
| PR | #1087 open from `atomic/10c-feedback-auto-pr` to `main` before final merge |
| D0 state | issue `1085`, PR URL exact, `pr_open` |
| Telegram | report message id `3386` |

No issue body, raw Telegram content, actor identity, credential, provider secret, or database URL is written to the evidence.

## Reused practices

- GitHub Docs, [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request): “To create a pull request, use the `gh pr create` subcommand.”
- Git, [git-worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree): “A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check out more than one branch at a time.”

The implementation reuses the already-loaded D0 label and launchd job, the shared agent runner, and Git worktrees. It does not introduce another developer loop.
