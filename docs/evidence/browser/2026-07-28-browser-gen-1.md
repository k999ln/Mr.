# BROWSER-GEN-1 production evidence

## Verdict

Real external action succeeded. Rockstar_ibot received a natural-language Telegram
request, used Railway-private Steel Chromium, opened a live Luma event, filled the
agent-owned registration identity, submitted the form, passed a managed Cloudflare
browser check, and captured the provider-authored result **“You’re In”**.

This is not a dry run, fixture, fake CDP session, or navigation-only smoke.

## Readback correction and challenge evidence

The successful run's first boolean classifier returned `confirmed=false` despite
its own `status=confirmed`, because the page also contained the word `verify`.
Telegram photo `350` is the independent provider screen proving the action. The
classifier was corrected in production commit
`410decb5079c4e10a794abc502e2073b322521f2`: provider-authored “You’re In” now
counts as success while optional email verification to manage an existing
registration does not negate it.

Cloudflare is nondeterministic from the datacenter session:

| Class | Job | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| managed check passed | `73d313c0-2574-49d2-8aad-e40665db0cdb` | provider page says `You’re In` | Telegram photo `350` |
| managed check still running | `a560a351-b6b6-4e4d-a0b9-dc8ba4298ac1` | honest `pending_challenge`, no success claim | Telegram photo `354` |
| challenge detected | `a3f72829-2fbc-4e9c-897b-b3e0df0fbb46` | honest `handoff_required` | Telegram photo `346` |

Every run released its Steel session. Interactive CAPTCHA, login, 2FA, KYC, and
payment remain fail-closed; the implementation does not bypass them.

## Boundary of this evidence

BROWSER-GEN-1 is complete: one real provider action and receipt crossed the whole
Telegram → Rockstar_ibot → Railway Steel → provider → Telegram path. This does not
complete BROWSER-AUTH-1, the three-intent BROWSER-MATRIX-1, or recovery coverage
for every provider/challenge class.
