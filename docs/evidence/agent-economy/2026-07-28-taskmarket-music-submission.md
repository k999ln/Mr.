# TaskMarket external music-work submission evidence

## Claim boundary

This evidence proves a second colony-external TaskMarket bounty was completed,
tested, submitted, independently read back, and added to the award monitor. It
does **not** prove revenue. The task remains open with zero awards, so verified
external revenue remains `$0.00`.

## Real model and iteration

The first configured provider, APIFRAME/Suno V5, returned HTTP `400` with
`not enough credits`; it produced no artifact. The existing agent-owned
ElevenLabs account was then used with **ElevenLabs Music v2**, following its
official composition-plan and 320 kbps output contract.

Version 1 was rejected before submission because its measured trough was not
quieter than the preceding peak. Version 2 fixed the plan itself: a low-context
`ppp` trough with no bass/cello/percussion, followed by a longer rebuild and a
larger second peak. The model's leading/trailing silence was trimmed; sections
were not rearranged.

## Final acceptance

## Monitor recovery

After submission, another stale worktree installer had replaced the same
TaskMarket label with a nonexistent `taskmarket-award-ledger-boot.sh`, producing
exit `127`. The exact broken label alone was reloaded from merged canonical main.
The next run returned exit `0`, stderr empty, and
`tasks_seen=3 / pending=3 / recorded=0`. All six pre-existing Rockstar_ibot
labels remained loaded throughout.
