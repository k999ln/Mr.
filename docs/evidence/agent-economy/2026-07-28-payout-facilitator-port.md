# Rockstar_ibot payout facilitator dedicated-port repair

## Failure reproduced

Rockstar_ibot reserves loopback port `8406` for the production payout facilitator. `services/facilitator/start.sh` exported `PORT=8406`, but both checked-in facilitator configs contained `"port": 8405`. The x402-rs binary treats the config value as authoritative, started on `8405`, and made the wrapper's `8406/health` readiness check fail after 15 seconds.

This was observed with the real release binary and Base mainnet config before any Rockstar_ibot user payout existed. No existing launchd loop was stopped.

## RED → GREEN

`services/facilitator/tests/start-port-contract.sh` copies the wrapper into a bounded temporary sandbox and launches a real HTTP fake facilitator whose bind port comes only from `CONFIG`.

| State | Result |
|---|---|
| RED, original wrapper | exit `1`: `facilitator failed to start` because requested port and config port differed |
| GREEN, runtime-config wrapper | PASS: requested port served `/health`, canonical config SHA-256 unchanged |

The wrapper now validates the requested port and writes a mode-`0600` per-port runtime config under `state/`, changing only its `port` field. x402-rs receives that runtime config; the checked-in chain configuration is never mutated.

## Live verification

The repaired wrapper started the real release binary on `127.0.0.1:8406` with the Base mainnet config. Both `/health` and `/supported` advertised x402 v2 `exact` on `eip155:8453`. The temporary verification process was then stopped by exact PID; no persistent loop was changed.

The same real facilitator binary separately verified and settled the agent-owned bootstrap transfer `0x65034f070374f7dd6ce624717dfaad909b93f663ebe2deddc3925bf8b2ef8741` on Base, proving the release binary's mainnet settlement path. That transfer is not a Rockstar_ibot user payout and is not external revenue.

Focused verification:

- shell syntax: PASS
- dedicated-port black-box contract: PASS
- `base-usdc-payout` + `run-agent-payout`: 18/18 PASS
- live `8406` `/health` and `/supported`: PASS

## Remaining boundary

The 13d engine no longer has the dedicated-port startup defect, but an actual user payout still requires verified external surplus above the `$35` reserve. Until 13c produces that economic state, 13d remains pending.
