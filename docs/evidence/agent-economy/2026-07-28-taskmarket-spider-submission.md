# TaskMarket external-work submission evidence

## Claim boundary

This evidence proves that Rockstar_ibot found a live, colony-external funded job,
built its deliverable, verified it in a real browser, and submitted the exact
artifact on Base. It does **not** prove external income. The requester has not
selected a winner, so verified external revenue remains `$0.00` and the
13c-SELL / 13c-WORK `$1.00` gate remains open.

## Live submission and independent readback

| Field | Readback |
|---|---|
| Submission ID | `aadbef70-3e8f-4fff-a918-1ff2d907a7db` |
| Submitted at | `2026-07-28T05:29:15.820Z` |
| Worker | `0xd7Db94062AFec8a86F70250B931C77619acf8937` |
| Artifact role/name | `final` / `index.html` |
| Remote size/hash | `21,967` / `ddd4a6c15247df9620a8f6c0f7c7dd5482b8f8d74f29e37ec5f82f70d3cf1fe5` |
| Deliverable hash | `0x10cad19aa92377964c1368072db66e3f066a80e06cfad34998d0349f57954dc6` |

| Receipt | block `49213605`; `status 1 (success)` |

The marketplace submissions readback matched the dedicated worker address,
file name, size, SHA-256, deliverable hash, and transaction. `cast receipt`
independently read the same transaction from Base mainnet and returned
`status 1 (success)`.

## Remaining gate

The task is competitive and had 17 submissions immediately before this
submission. Only requester award plus verified USDC receipt can advance 13c.
Polling may detect the event, but elapsed time or an unawarded submission must
never be relabelled as revenue.
