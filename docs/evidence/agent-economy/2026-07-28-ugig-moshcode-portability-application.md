The fix changes only the test expectation to match `skillName`'s documented
lowercase normalization. It does not pretend the existing product behavior is a
new feature.

The delivered application is included in Rockstar_ibot's production uGig
observer. The observer will not create an invoice until the external buyer
accepts the application and PR #61 is merged. An invoice or application status
alone does not count as revenue; 13c advances only after independently verified
external wallet/chain receipt and exactly-once ledger entry.
