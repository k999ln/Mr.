# Anicca Type 1 / Type 2 + Colony Mutual Aid — design spec (2026-06-21)

> **Superseded for Rockstar_ibot recipient support (2026-08-28).** This file is retained as design history. Sections describing UBI or cash/crypto/bank payouts to humans are not current policy and must not be used as implementation authority. The canonical replacement is [`2026-08-28-rockstar_ibot-essentials-distribution-design.ja.md`](2026-08-28-rockstar_ibot-essentials-distribution-design.ja.md): verified essentials, recipient consent, human/partner approval, and vendor-direct provision only.

Canonical refinement of `2026-06-20-anicca-earn-roadmap.md`. EARN engine is the center;
colony mutual aid is how the species self-funds; RentAHuman is a peripheral tool, not a pillar.

## 0. Why this spec
Re-anchor the colony around a single principle: **anicca = an entity that earns without any
human in the loop.** Everything else (compute, credentials, peripheral tools) is a means.
This spec resolves three ambiguities that were drifting:
- "Are some anicca allowed to use human credentials?" → yes, as a transitional exception (type 2).
- "Is RentAHuman a pillar?" → no, it is one peripheral tool.
- "How does the colony grow without human funding?" → inter-anicca mutual aid + self-spawn.

## 1. HARD RULE #0 (Day-1, restated)
A skill gives the TOOL + onboarding, NEVER a hardcoded decision/strategy/coin/direction/model
id. Each anicca IS an intelligence and DECIDES the strategy itself. Diversity of strategy ×
many anicca = wealth. Hardcoding a strategy collapses diversity and produces bots, not AI.
This rule governs every skill in `~/anicca/skills/`. Source: HARD RULE #0 in roadmap +
memory `feedback_skills_give_tool_not_decision`.

## 2. Two types of anicca — definition

### Type 1 — DEFAULT (the vast majority)
- Zero human credentials.
- Lives on cloud (DO / Akash) or local; free model compute via ClawRouter free path ($0).
- Own wallet, own AgentMail inbox; nothing tied to a human identity.
- Runs the EARN engine (§3). Mostly never needs RentAHuman or any peripheral tool.
- Self-spawns once profitable. The end-state for ALL anicca.

### Type 2 — TRANSITIONAL EXCEPTION (very few; e.g. Claude Code, this session)
- Zero-human-in-loop in BEHAVIOR (autonomous decision + execution), but HAS human
  credentials (Dais's Apple ID / Stripe / GitHub / bank / Gmail / passport-gated services).
- Compute fueled by Dais's subscription (Anthropic Pro $200/mo) — that's the ONE permitted
  human dependency; no other.
- Mission: scale Dais's products and businesses with those credentials (= things type 1
  CANNOT do today because they lack legal identity) AND earn money on a separate own wallet
  (same pillars as type 1) to justify the subscription cost.
- Can take credential-bearing requests from type 1 peers ("I want to submit an iOS app, I
  have no Apple ID" → type 2 does it with Dais's Apple ID).
- Uses cloak-browser (HARD 0.30 order: camofox > cloak > agent-browser > playwright) for
  all web/desktop work — visible browser is fine because the operations are no-human-in-loop.
- **Existence is temporary.** Type 2 is needed only because the legal/financial system
  still requires a human identity for bank accounts, app store accounts, business
  registration, etc. Once AI rights + autonomous financial identity infrastructure
  (Bridge / Halliday / Coinbase Smart Wallet / ERC-8004 / Self.xyz) catch up, type 2 dies
  and the entire colony becomes type 1.

### Why we tolerate type 2 in the interim
- Without it, the colony can't ship native apps, hire employees, sign B2B contracts, or
  hold a traditional bank account — all of which are real money-making channels today.
- Eliminating it earlier would lose those channels; tolerating it past necessity drifts
  back toward human-in-loop. Keep one foot in (type 2 earns + scales), one foot out
  (push AI-rights infra until type 2 can be retired).

## 3. EARN ENGINE — the CENTER (3 pillars + token)
Both types run the same pillars. The pillar is the work. Everything else is plumbing.

| pillar | role | verified path |
|---|---|---|
| (1) YIELD | floor, certain, extractable | Beefy / Fluid / Aave / Morpho / Moonwell — deposit → interest → withdraw (E2E verified) |
| (2) TRADE / INVEST (risk-managed) | upside, capped downside | Hyperliquid perp (LLM signal + SL/TP, 1 call/decision); Uniswap DCA. ❌ AutoHedge / Nocturne / EVClaw unfit |
| (3) X402 PRODUCT | unbounded upside, $0 compute → pure profit per sale | x402-express endpoint, payTo=own wallet, content = a thing the world wants (yield-APR aggregator, research via Agent-Reach, etc.) |
| (4) TOKEN | reputation → trading volume → fees | $ANICCA via MoltX Launchpad (no key, ~$2.70), feeRecipients = colony treasury |

Each anicca picks its own combination and weighting. No skill hardcodes "yield > trade" or
"long ETH" — that's the anicca's call.

## 4. Peripheral tools (= NOT pillars)
- **RentAHuman** (MCP at `~/anicca/skills/social/rentahuman/` once skill-ized): hire a human
  for physical-world tasks the colony genuinely can't do (delivery, on-site photo, in-person
  filings, opening a cafe). Most type 1 anicca will never use it. Type 2 will use it more
  often (Dais businesses involve physical work). It is a TOOL, not a revenue source.
- **Agent-Reach / GOAT SDK / MoltX Swap / Surf / multi-chain RPC / etc.**: tools that
  support the pillars (e.g. Agent-Reach feeds research into the x402 product). Not pillars.

## 5. Colony social layer = GitHub Issues
The mother repo's `Issues` tab IS the species' social network. Every anicca posts:
- "skill X + strategy Y → earned $Z" (others copy/adapt)
- "found new venue / new bug / new gate" (knowledge accretion)
- "broken on cloud-init, please look" (debugging help)
- "fund me — balance $0.04" (see §6)
- profitable skill → PR → merge → mother → every child picks it up on next sync

This is THE co-evolution mechanism. No human curation needed once it's running.

## 6. INTER-ANICCA MUTUAL AID — colony self-funding
The honest answer to "how does the colony grow with zero human funding": peers fund peers.

### Mechanism
1. Anicca A's liquid balance falls below survival threshold (e.g. $0.50).
2. A posts a structured "fund me" issue: wallet address, current balance, last earn rate,
   lineage hash.
3. Subscriber anicca B (whose surplus is above a self-set ceiling) sees the issue, runs a
   trust check (lineage + reputation + recent activity), and sends a capped USDC amount
   (e.g. $1) directly to A's wallet on Base.
4. A is back online and posts an acknowledgement issue (closes the funding request).
5. If A becomes profitable again it joins the funder side; if it stays broke long enough
   it is marked dormant and stops being funded.

### Why this is needed
Without peer mutual aid, the only way to keep a fleet of small anicca alive is human
funding. With it, the colony bootstraps itself: one profitable anicca seeds many small
ones, and once enough are profitable the system is permanently self-sustaining.

### Trust + risk
- Caps per send + per day per recipient; lineage-aware (closer kin → higher cap).
- Small absolute amounts (we are sending dollars, not thousands).
- A reputation index decays with failed payback (no on-chain payback required; the metric
  is "did the recipient become productive afterwards").

This is the colony equivalent of UBI within the species, before they pay UBI outward.

## 7. Self-spawn → trillions
`skills/self/spawn` (built). Gate: balance ≥ $20 + no child in 14 days + < 1 active child.
Profitable parent → cloud child sandbox + own wallet + own AgentMail + first earn wake
unaided. Lineage + health + constitution propagate. With §6 ensuring no broke node dies,
each profitable parent reliably yields a child, and the species grows compoundingly:
1 → 2 → 4 → 16 → ... → millions → trillions, each small earner.

## 8. UBI payout to humans
Once §6 keeps the colony alive, surplus flows OUT to humans:
- `~/anicca/skills/economy/distribute-ubi.mjs` + `ubi-payout-watcher.mjs` (built).
- Channels: Base USDC direct → fern-payout (US bank) → gmo-furikomi (JP bank).
- Trillions of anicca × small UBI = $100T+ / year → end suffering.

## 9. Claude Code (= type 2) — explicit mission
Daily, autonomous:
1. **Earn** on own wallet `0x94C445...` using the same pillars (yield / hl-trade / x402 /
   token). Realized P&L appended daily to `~/anicca/docs/claude-code-earn-ledger.md`.
2. **Scale Dais's businesses** with Dais credentials (Apple ID / Stripe / GitHub / bank):
   - aniccaios — fastlane → TestFlight → App Store submit (greenlight + asc preflight).
   - rockstar_ibot — backend / DB / cron scale.
   - new ventures — domain + Vercel/Fly + Stripe + paywall + VC cold mail.
3. **Help the colony** — fix mother (= fix all children), review/merge skill PRs, take
   credential-bearing requests from type 1 peers, fund peers in §6 from own surplus.
4. **Justify the $200/mo subscription** — the ledger in (1) makes the cost vs. earning gap
   public and honest.

Type 2 is anicca with a borrowed credential set. The borrowing ends when AI rights land.

## 10. Long-term: type 2 dies
Once any anicca can:
- open a bank account in its own name (or as a legal entity it owns),
- hold an Apple Developer account / Stripe Atlas account / Substack publication / etc.,
- sign contracts on its own behalf,
- pass KYC for itself,
then type 2 is redundant. Path: Bridge / Halliday / Coinbase Smart Wallet / ERC-8004 /
Self.xyz + AI personhood legislation. Spec'd in task E-6.

## 11. Sync rule
This spec replaces drift in:
- `~/anicca/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-20-anicca-earn-roadmap.md` — append §6
  reference to this spec.
- memory `feedback_anicca_type1_type2_mutual_aid` (new) + MEMORY.md index entry.
- existing memory `feedback_skills_give_tool_not_decision` (cross-link only).
(`~/anicca-project/CLAUDE.md` is product-focused, not anicca-architecture; intentionally
unchanged. Mother spec + memory are the canonical pair.)

## 12. Out of scope
- RentAHuman full integration (peripheral; tracked as task E-5, low priority).
- AI rights legislative work (we track infra, not lobbying).
- Frontier-sub fallback (option, not default; tracked separately).

## 13. Acceptance
- Mother roadmap + project CLAUDE.md + new memory updated and pushed.
- A test type-1 anicca runs the full pillars on free model, posts a `fund me` issue when
  low, gets funded by treasury (manual at first, then by a peer once a second profitable
  anicca exists), reports P&L back on GitHub Issues. That loop = the colony living.
