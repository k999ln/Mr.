# Rockstar_ibot Portable Runtime + Finance + Self-Improving Marketing Platform Design

**Status:** Canonical program SSOT
**Scope owner:** Rockstar_ibot
**Canonical repository:** `https://github.com/Daisuke134/life-manager`
**Current release:** OpenClaw-to-Rockstar-Ibot Portable Runtime Migration (local incident recovery)
**First production products:** Anicca iOS and Honne AI
**Primary outcome:** every retained loop runs from a Rockstar_ibot-owned local
process with zero OpenClaw dependency. A hosted/cloud profile is future work
and is not an incident-recovery gate.

**Current implementation cursor:** the portable contracts, bounded
financial-report adapter, shared adapter registry, generic video publication
adapter/chain, and one historical Honne JA shadow receipt are proven in code.
The checked-in `runtime-up` path still contains the historical compose/
PostgreSQL adapter, but MKT-01 now provides the accepted direct-process/
file-ledger path for the incident canary. A real provider canary remains
gated on MKT-02 and MKT-03; the historical database path is not used by the
local recovery runtime.
The current production incident is separate from those proofs: as measured on
2026-08-20 JST, every relevant OpenClaw marketing cron is disabled in the live
SQLite scheduler, every Larry/ReelClaw LaunchAgent is explicitly disabled and
unloaded, and no Rockstar_ibot marketing scheduler/worker is running. Postiz is
connected and the Anicca/Honne TikTok integrations remain enabled, so billing
or provider authentication is not the proximate stop cause. The next active
slice is controlled recovery from Rockstar_ibot: keep the quarantined legacy
state unchanged, restore one known-good product lane, emit a direct public URL
and missed-slot alert to Telegram, prove seven expected cycles, and only then
expand to the remaining Anicca/Honne producers. This incident recovery preserves
existing behavior under Orders 9 and 11; it does not activate post-migration
feature work.

**Near-term mobile-marketing target.** This is a restoration, not a new
marketing-system invention: reuse the retained accounts, creatives, cadence
contracts, and Postiz routes that already worked, move their execution behind
Rockstar_ibot, and return each approved account to three expected posts per day.
The return is one account at a time so a known-broken lane is repaired before
its first post; old OpenClaw cron labels remain disabled as rollback evidence.

**Incident recovery execution correction (2026-08-21 JST).** The original
OpenClaw marketing runtime was not Docker-, Colima-, Railway-, or
PostgreSQL-based. The current recovery therefore runs locally from the
canonical checkout as a direct Rockstar_ibot process (optionally supervised by
the local OS after an explicit cutover gate). Its durable state is owned by a
Rockstar_ibot data root (`LM_DATA_DIR`, default
`~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot`) using append-only JSONL ledgers and atomic
claim/lease/receipt files. No database, container runtime, Railway service, or
OpenClaw folder/env/assets is a prerequisite. MKT-01 ports the I-3 claim,
receipt, replay, and Telegram-dedupe boundary to this local ledger. External
provider/Telegram sends remain gated until the lane manifest and controlled
canary slices; no real send was performed by MKT-01.

## 1. Executive decision

Rockstar_ibot becomes the single control plane for personal health and autonomous
income loops. The Portable Runtime Migration ships first. Until its local and
cloud gates pass, new finance, marketing-learning, health, and app-generation
features are frozen except where they are required to preserve an existing loop
during migration.

The current incident release has one required outcome and one deferred option:

```text
Required incident outcome — local:
  the retained lane runs from a Rockstar_ibot-owned direct local process,
  filesystem ledgers, and local secret boundary with OpenClaw stopped and
  ~/.openclaw inaccessible

Deferred option — hosted:
  a future adapter may run the same contracts in a hosted environment;
  Railway, Docker/Colima, PostgreSQL, and cloud workers are not part of this
  incident and do not block local recovery
```

Repository identity is not inferred from a local directory name:

| Role | GitHub identity | Local state | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Only active SSOT** | [`Daisuke134/life-manager`](https://github.com/Daisuke134/life-manager), repository ID `1248111245` | canonical checkout is currently `/Users/operator/Projects/rockstar_ibot-main` | all new code, specs, plans, issues, CI, deployment config, schedules, and release evidence live here |
| Legacy historical source | [`Daisuke134/life-manager-v0`](https://github.com/Daisuke134/life-manager-v0), repository ID `1273052304` | archived read-only; any old local clone is non-runtime | no new work, runtime, scheduler, CI, or deployment may target it; 35/35 disposition, issue transfer, redirect, archive, and runtime-reference-zero gate are complete |
| Temporary worktrees | branches whose Git common directory is the canonical repository | multiple paths may exist during bounded work | a worktree is not another repository or SSOT; merge or retire it when its task closes |

The selected incident architecture is local direct-process/file-ledger first;
hosted local/cloud parity is deferred and is not a recovery prerequisite:

| Plane | Runtime | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Portable application | Rockstar_ibot packages and direct processes; no container requirement | accounts, products, schedules, jobs, ledgers, attribution, experiments, reports, panel, Telegram |
| Local deployment | direct `rockstar_ibot` process from the canonical checkout, with optional local OS supervision | private/self-hosted operation without Docker, Colima, Railway, PostgreSQL, or any OpenClaw process/folder |
| Hosted deployment (deferred) | provider-neutral processes and storage adapters | future always-on/multi-tenant operation; not an incident-recovery prerequisite |
| Data plane | Rockstar_ibot-owned append-only JSONL ledgers plus atomic claim/lease/receipt files | immutable events, content lineage, metrics, experiments, job state; no mandatory database |
| Object plane | Rockstar_ibot-owned local data root and filesystem artifacts | media, evidence, exports, signed migration archives; never `~/.openclaw` |
| Secrets | Rockstar_ibot-owned local secret boundary (OS keychain or guarded local env file) | credentials and browser sessions; never stored in prompts, job payloads, logs, or Git |

### 1.1 Deployment and commercial boundary

Local is the only deployment profile in this incident. A future hosted profile
may reuse the same contracts, but it is deferred and must not fork or block the
local recovery.

| Mode | Operator | Availability | Current commercial rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local/self-hosted | user operates Rockstar_ibot on Mac or Linux | depends on the user's machine and internet | no managed-cloud monthly subscription is required; the user supplies hardware and connector/provider costs |
| Cloud/hosted (deferred) | Rockstar_ibot may later operate versioned services on a provider-neutral host | future always-on mode; not used by this incident and no Railway deployment is assumed | any future subscription/entitlement design is outside the local recovery gate |

Annual, lifetime, and usage-only plans are outside the current release. No
numeric price is authorized until measured per-tenant infrastructure and
connector costs establish a sustainable floor.

The migration order is mandatory:

```text
archived historical `life-manager-v0` + one writable canonical repository
  → self-contained canonical repository (`Daisuke134/life-manager`)
  → OpenClaw-dependent local
  → Rockstar_ibot-owned local
  → portable local/cloud parity
  → cloud-default production
```

`life-manager-v0`, OpenClaw, Profitable Claude, and repository-specific launchd jobs are migration
sources only. Every retained script, asset, prompt, schedule, state file, and
credential reference moves behind Rockstar_ibot-owned contracts and paths
before cloud migration begins. Legacy repositories remain intact until parity
and rollback evidence pass.

## 2. Goal and non-goals

### Goal

`done = true` only when all of the following are true:

1. Every OpenClaw cron entry and relevant launchd job is classified as
   `migrate`, `replace`, or `retire`; no enabled or loaded job is unowned.
2. Stopping `ai.openclaw.gateway` and denying access to `~/.openclaw` does not
   interrupt any retained Rockstar_ibot loop.
3. Runtime code, config, schedules, secrets, assets, and state contain no read,
   execute, import, or fallback dependency on `~/.openclaw`,
   `/Users/operator/profitable-claude`, or `/Users/operator/anicca`.
4. The Rockstar_ibot local entrypoint runs all retained loops from
   Rockstar_ibot-owned code, a local data root, and local secret boundary.
5. A future hosted adapter may run the same contracts; hosted parity is not a
   prerequisite for this incident and must not introduce an OpenClaw fallback.
6. The Rockstar_ibot panel and Telegram show the same reconciled financial
   snapshot, including freshness and unavailable-source states.
7. Every published mobile creative has lineage:
   `product → campaign → experiment → format → hook → artifact → publication
   → platform metrics → install → trial → paid revenue`.
8. A learning promotion changes one bounded rule, passes a canary, is consumed
   by the next generation run, and can be reverted from a durable receipt.
9. Anicca iOS and Honne AI each have independent product packs, goals,
   attribution, metrics, and learned weights.
10. A new user can connect a product and run the same engine without Anicca
   names, paths, accounts, or credentials.
11. In cloud mode, powering off the Mac Mini does not interrupt any production
   loop; Codex on the Mac is an optional command client, not an executor.
12. Cloud worker capacity scales horizontally with tenant demand and enforces
   per-tenant quotas, rate limits, concurrency limits, and fair scheduling.
13. GitHub, CI, Railway, local launchd during migration, and every canonical
    spec resolve to repository ID `1248111245`; repository ID `1273052304` is
    read-only archived after a signed import/equivalence manifest passes.

### Non-goals for the first release

| Deferred item | Reason |
|---|---|
| New financial connectors and the full Financial Health dashboard | Preserve and migrate the existing report first; expand it only after local and cloud runtime parity |
| New marketing formats or autonomous self-improvement | Migrate current posting behavior first; activate learning only after publication and metric receipts survive local/cloud parity |
| Autonomous mobile-app creation and App Store submission | Prove growth of existing apps before generalizing the development loop |
| Physical- and mental-health expansion | Preserve currently retained health behavior; new automation follows runtime migration |
| Deleting OpenClaw or legacy repositories | Do not delete history. `life-manager-v0` is archived after its dedicated import/equivalence gate; other runtime sources are disabled and archived only after shadow, canary, restart, and dependency tests |
| Trading with user funds | Financial health is read-only reporting; execution requires a separate risk and authorization spec |
| Accepting raw Apple IDs or passwords | App Store Connect API keys and delegated authorization are safer and automation-compatible |
| Claiming guaranteed `$10k MRR` | `$10k MRR` is a measurable target with explicit assumptions, not a promise |

## 3. Evidence: current state

### 3.1 Measured runtime state

| System | Measured state | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical GitHub repository | `Daisuke134/life-manager`, repository ID `1248111245`, public/unarchived, default branch `main`; 3,241 tracked files in the measured checkout | This is the only write/deploy/spec target |
| Legacy GitHub repository | `Daisuke134/life-manager-v0`, repository ID `1273052304`, public/archived, default branch `main`; 35 tracked files, open issue/PR・workflow/webhook/deployment 0 | Retirement complete: 35/35 disposition, missing required behavior 0, canonical redirect exactly1, active runtime reference 0 |
| Local repository naming | canonical repo is cloned as `rockstar_ibot-main`; the directory named `rockstar_ibot` actually points to `life-manager-v0` | Directory names are unsafe identifiers; use remote URL plus repository ID until the legacy clone is quarantined and the canonical checkout is normalized |
| Live Rockstar_ibot launchd paths | measured Rockstar_ibot daily, dev, financial, payout, self-build, TaskMarket, uGig, and x402 jobs point to `/Users/operator/Projects/rockstar_ibot-main`; none point to `life-manager-v0` | Runtime already selects the canonical repository, but remains local and path-bound |
| Local OpenClaw gateway | Running as `ai.openclaw.gateway` | OpenClaw is still running |
| OpenClaw scheduler | Read-only capture contains 222 stored jobs; 92 are marked enabled | Stored/enabled is not proof of current execution; each row remains unclassified until Task 2 assigns a verified disposition |
| macOS launchd | Read-only capture contains 176 user LaunchAgent plist files and one additional relevant loaded-only label; 161 plist-backed labels are currently loaded. The loaded CFO plist cannot be parsed by `plutil`, and `com.anicca.daemon` has no user LaunchAgent plist; both are preserved as explicit parse errors | launchd is the actual scheduler for many observed loops; malformed or loaded-only rows must not be silently dropped or changed |
| Unified runtime inventory | `docs/migrations/openclaw/runtime-inventory.json` contains all 399 captured OpenClaw and relevant LaunchAgent rows; 269 are enabled or loaded; commands and private identifiers are redacted | All 399 rows now carry one measured disposition (214 migrate, 40 replace, 132 retire, 13 retain-external; zero `unclassified`) with owners and rollback actions per `docs/migrations/openclaw/classification-summary.md`; no scheduler change is authorized by the inventory |
| Profitable Claude marketing engine | Registry, schemas, bounded learning, canary keep/revert, observation terminalizer, and dashboard exist | Reuse these contracts |
| Marketing runtime store | About 20 KB; dashboard and logs only; no run, publication, metric, experiment, or observation ledgers | The production feedback loop is not closed |
| Rockstar_ibot Railway | `/health` returns 200 from `life-call-production.up.railway.app` | A functioning cloud control plane already exists |
| Rockstar_ibot panel | Timeline, connection, score, gate, API cost, and limited financial-ledger projections exist | Extend; do not build a second dashboard |
| Financial report loop | the legacy launchd loop remains active; the Rockstar_ibot local scheduler/job/worker path separately sent real Telegram `message_id=432` with immutable snapshot/effect receipt and restart count `1 → 1` | Report execution is OpenClaw-independent and shadow-ready; scheduler ownership is intentionally not cut over until seven expected runs |
| Financial report scope | x402/TaskMarket/USDC earnings, fees, losses, API costs, payout reserve | Bank, App Store, Stripe, broader crypto, and business P&L are absent |
| Moneytree connector | One connected Japanese bank account is readable | Bank balance can seed the personal balance sheet; account identifiers must stay private |
| Historical Anicca metrics | 299 seven-day downloads on 2026-05-15; subsequent snapshot showed zero due to ASC collection failure; historical trial start rate about 3.5–3.8% | Data quality must be first-class; zero and unavailable cannot be conflated |

RevenueCat administration and credential operations belong to the separate
Anicca iOS/API product boundary. They are not a Rockstar_ibot connector, metric
source, implementation cursor, or completion gate. Hosted Rockstar_ibot
entitlement remains Stripe-based.

### 3.2 Mobile marketing incident snapshot (2026-08-20 JST)

This read-only incident measurement supersedes the historical launch state below.
No legacy job was triggered, enabled, disabled, stopped, or restarted during the
measurement.

| Boundary | Measured fact | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| OpenClaw runtime scheduler | current read-only `openclaw cron list --all --json` reports 319 live scheduler rows; the enabled-only view exposes exactly one enabled job, unrelated `o1c14-funder-program-discovery-daily` with `lastStatus=error`. Mobile-marketing/Larry/ReelClaw rows exist in the live inventory but are disabled. The older on-disk `cron/jobs.json` has only 222 rows: all 32 Larry/ReelClaw-named rows are disabled, while several differently named social jobs retain stale `enabled=true` bytes that disagree with live scheduler state | files, mere row presence, and old enabled flags are not execution proof; OpenClaw is not currently scheduling these mobile-marketing posts |
| macOS launchd | 39 relevant marketing plists remain on disk; zero relevant labels are loaded; the persistent launchd override explicitly disables all 25 Larry/ReelClaw labels | the legacy clock stopped on 2026-08-01; files on disk are not evidence of execution |
| Quarantine evidence | `jobs.json.pre-marketing-quarantine-20260801T0955.bak` and the final launchd logs align with a 2026-08-01 09:55 JST marketing quarantine | the exact actor and intent are unproven; do not mass-enable the old fleet |
| Postiz account | `GET /public/v1/is-connected` returns `connected=true`; integrations return 29 total, 28 enabled, one disabled | cancellation is not the proximate cause |
| Target TikTok integrations | Honne JA `@honnevideo`, Honne EN `@honne_reveal`, Anicca `@anicca.jp4`, and Anicca iOS `@anicca.jp` all return `disabled=false` | provider routing remains configured; TikTok-side publishing credentials remain unproven until a controlled canary |
| JP4 provider recheck (2026-08-21 JST) | Postiz `GET /public/v1/integrations` returns JP4 `HTTP 200`, `disabled=false`; Postiz `GET /public/v1/analytics/cmn8x8hdv028uqx0y4gdfse5t` returns `HTTP 200` with Followers `122`, Videos `303`, and Views `12,510` | the JP4 token can answer read-only provider calls; this does not prove that TikTok accepts a new direct publication |
| Rockstar_ibot replacement | generic generation/publication contracts exist, but no Rockstar_ibot-owned local marketing scheduler or worker process is currently running | migration code has not yet replaced production scheduling; Docker, Colima, Railway, and a database are not prerequisites |
| Telegram observation | the post notifier repeatedly measures zero posts and sends zero publication messages; daily generic reports still send | zero-output silence must become a missed-expected-slot alert |
| Shared learner | mining fails on judge/source ingestion; scoring skips because only three posts meet the 24-hour cohort and the minimum is ten | there is no closed self-improvement loop today |

The last verified public target posts are:

- Honne JA: `https://www.tiktok.com/@honnevideo/video/7668837367739418632`
- Honne EN: `https://www.tiktok.com/@honne_reveal/video/7668814897594779655`
- Anicca JP4: `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp4/video/7668590687105058834`
- Anicca iOS: `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp/video/7668475610708232200`

Honne EN/JA were healthy through their final runs. Several Anicca ReelClaw and
Larry producers were already broken before quarantine by missing hook files,
blank hook IDs, poster argument failures, and fragile environment loading.
Therefore bulk re-enablement is not a valid rollback.

### 3.2.1 Current verified delivery and metric matrix

This is the current operational truth, not the desired three-post policy. A
`verified` row has a Rockstar_ibot receipt, an exact public artifact URL, and a
natural-language Telegram receipt. Provider account metrics are useful for
health only; they are not post-level attribution and are never treated as
installs, trials, or revenue.

| Product/account | Verified destination and latest Rockstar_ibot proof | Telegram | Current provider metric state | Operational state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Honne EN `@honne_reveal` | TikTok; approved ReelClaw direct URL `7676419421304425748` | `27482` | 24h native post and account metrics are preserved with unsupported fields unavailable; 72h/7d observations remain pending | verified metric source; scheduled 0/day, default-off during recovery |
| Honne JA `@honnevideo` | TikTok; approved ReelClaw direct URL `7676425660641889537` | `27515` | 24h native post Views `1,035`, Likes `11`, Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, engagement `1.06%`; Followers `4`, Following `8`, Total Likes `923`, Videos `278`, latest-20 Views `5,650` / Likes `42` / Comments `0` / Shares `0`; reach/watch time/completion unavailable | verified metric source; scheduled 0/day, default-off during recovery |
| Anicca iOS main `@anicca.jp` / `@anicca.jp1` | TikTok `7676422253638176020` remains verified. Instagram `DcTFx_UjSio` proves the native Card/account but is quarantined as a success candidate because caption `強い人の口癖…` does not match its baked hook `怠けてるんじゃない…` | `27500`; Instagram `27510` is historical only | TikTok 24h native post Views `108`, Likes/Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, engagement `0%`; Reach/Watch time/Completion unavailable. TikTok account Followers `257`, Following `33`, Total Likes `17,662`, Videos `470`, latest-20 Views `5,296` / Likes `51` / Comments `1` / Shares `2`; historical Instagram post Views/Reach `6`, other reported counts `0` | TikTok verified; Instagram pack-ready/default-off and exact canary open |
| Anicca JP4 `@anicca.jp4` | TikTok; approved card direct URL `7676495865816632583` | `27939` | Followers `122`, Videos `304`, account Views `11,868`; post-level/install/revenue join open | verified canary; default-off |
| Anicca HE `@anicca.he` | TikTok; existing Postiz row `cmt32u9dj00jxqp0yqdh6yi96` reconciled by exact native profile-caption readback to `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.he/video/7676500512308481296` | `28431` | post-level metric collection remains open | verified recovered effect; default-off |
| Anicca EN Card `@anicca.encards` | latest exact LM effect is Postiz `PUBLISHED` row `cmt9rbish00qylf0yw6gt9ulr`, creative `EN-CARD-V2-e678c823480f`, and Instagram Reel `https://www.instagram.com/reel/Dcfph70jorc/`; caption and bound English Card media match | `35175` | 2h/24h/72h/7d/daily are registered with the 30-minute LM owner and remain pending until due; unavailable is not zero | production-armed at 3/day, 08:45/12:45/21:30 JST; replay 0 |
| Anicca JA Larry `@ani.cca1234` | Instagram carousel `https://www.instagram.com/p/DceW-whAQT7/`; all six native slides match the ordered LM objects | `34328` | immediate post counts are measured `0`; account analytics is unavailable/empty response | verified canary; scheduled 0/day, default-off |
| Anicca EN Widget `@anicca.en` | Instagram Reel `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcekGtmjmOf/`; full native video matches the approved Widget pack | `34435` | immediate Views `14`; Reach/Saves/Likes/Comments/Shares `0`; account and product funnel sources unavailable | verified canary; scheduled 0/day, default-off |
| Anicca JA Widget `@anicca.jp.videos` | Instagram Reel `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcetvubDA4Z/`; exact owner/caption and full native video match the approved Widget pack | `34523` | immediate Views `173`, Reach `134`, Likes `1`, Saves/Comments/Shares `0`; account and product funnel sources unavailable | verified canary; scheduled 0/day, default-off |
| Remaining integrations without a verified canary, including Anicca JA Card and YouTube candidates | no new Rockstar_ibot verified publication receipt | none | no current Rockstar_ibot observation row | classified/default-off or held/unassigned; no provider write |

The remaining metric gap is explicit: TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube must each
produce platform-post observations at 2h/24h/72h/7d, then App Store Connect,
RevenueCat, and product analytics must join the same immutable creative and
campaign lineage. Missing data stays `unavailable`, never `0`.

**Seven-day provider readback.** The live Postiz window contains only thirteen
rows across the few accounts above; it is not evidence that every enabled
integration is receiving every video or slideshow. It includes the verified
receipts, the reconciled `@anicca.he` effect, two YouTube
errors, the reconciled-absent JP4 attempt, and quarantined legacy generic or
`lm_wake` rows. The remaining Larry/ReelClaw labels stay explicitly disabled
(twenty-six relevant labels in the live override) and no running legacy
publisher is used. An enabled Postiz integration is routing configuration, not
a claim of current posting, a direct public artifact, Telegram receipt, or
metrics completeness.

### 3.2.2 Recovery re-audit and corrected current truth

This later audit overrides stale completion and cadence claims elsewhere in
this document. It changes no provider or launchd state. The host currently has
30 live Postiz integrations: 17 TikTok, 8 Instagram, 3 YouTube, and 2 X. Of
those, 29 are provider-enabled. The Rockstar_ibot manifest describes the 28
mobile integrations as six `target` rows and 22 `hold` rows, but production
cycles do not read that manifest. It is therefore an inventory, not an effect
fence or scheduling control plane. Two enabled X integrations are outside it;
one produced 46 `PUBLISHED` rows and two `ERROR` rows during the same four-day
window.

The six selected mobile schedules remain loaded with calendar triggers. They
are not currently running, but automatic publication paths are still armed.
From 2026-08-22 through 2026-08-25 JST, their expected/provider-published
counts were:

| Destination | Runtime object and format | Configured cadence | Expected / Postiz `PUBLISHED` | Latest caption/account-bound native proof |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Honne EN TikTok `@honne_reveal` | existing vertical MP4; `reelclaw/relationship-confession`; English | 07:00, 11:00, 20:30 JST | 12 / 8 | `https://www.tiktok.com/@honne_reveal/video/7677930257042787605` |
| Honne JA TikTok `@honnevideo` | existing vertical MP4; `reelclaw/relationship-confession`; Japanese | 08:30, 12:30, 21:30 JST | 12 / 9 | `https://www.tiktok.com/@honnevideo/video/7677945699123629333` |
| Anicca main TikTok `@anicca.jp` | existing vertical MP4; `reelclaw-card/nudge-card`; Japanese | 08:00, 16:00, 22:37 JST | 12 / 5 | `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp/video/7677365911833070866` |
| Anicca JP4 TikTok `@anicca.jp4` | existing vertical MP4; `reelclaw-card/nudge-card`; Japanese | 09:15, 15:15, 20:45 JST | 12 / 2 | `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp4/video/7677106804039355656` for one exact effect only |
| Anicca HE TikTok `@anicca.he` | existing vertical MP4; `reelclaw-card/nudge-card`; Japanese | 07:15, 13:45, 18:15 JST | 12 / 5 | `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.he/video/7677725253916773653` |
| Anicca main Instagram Postiz `@anicca.jp1`, native `anicca.ios.jp` | same Anicca vertical MP4 as a Reel | 19:10 JST | 4 / 3 | `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcdZEvtET7s/`; latest unauthenticated HTML readback is not independently caption-verifiable |

The total is 32 `PUBLISHED` rows against 64 expected slots. Only 19 rows have
unique direct-native receipts under the current caption/account criterion; 13
provider-success/local-nonterminal effects remain: 12 `failed` jobs with
`unknown_effect=true` and one stale `running` job. They must be reconciled in
oldest-first order without retry or replacement publication. A separate false
completion also exists: two different JP4 video effects were bound to Postiz
row `cmt5exlqb00cjqk0yu6q2xftc` and native TikTok URL
`7677106804039355656` because provider reuse compared integration and caption
but not video hash, creative, or slot. Native thumbnail evidence supports the
first video and contradicts the second. The current completed-receipt API
cannot supersede that provider/video lineage, so this is a code and durable
state repair, not a profile-URL correction.

Current not-yet-classified mobile inventory remains `0/day` until handled one
account at a time:

- Instagram: `@anicca.affirmation`, `@anicca.bochi`, and `@obou.anicca`.
- TikTok: `@anicca_buddha`, `@anicca_slideshow`, `@anicca.comedy`,
  `@anicca.daily`, `@anicca.jp8`, `@anicca.jpx`, `@aniccaaffirmation`,
  `@aniccaen2`, `@aniccajp`, `@aniccajp2`, `@monk_anicca`,
  `@obou_anicca`.
- YouTube: `@anicca-affirmation-video`, `@anicca-ai`, and owner-skipped
  `@anicca-jp`. Only the last remains the one allowed YouTube skip.

There is no live Honne Instagram or YouTube integration, so dedicated Honne
profiles must be provisioned before either platform can be classified or
armed. No Anicca destination may be borrowed and relabelled as Honne.

The current publisher does not generate Larry photo slideshows. Legacy Larry
did generate six/seven-image affirmation slideshows and could cross-post an
Instagram carousel. Legacy ReelClaw card/widget jobs copied pre-rendered MP4
assets and changed captions; they were not per-run renderers. All audited
Larry/ReelClaw mobile OpenClaw cron jobs are now disabled and their related
LaunchAgents are unloaded. The pre-quarantine snapshot proves that some were
previously enabled, but their code accepted Postiz IDs, profile URLs, or
YouTube `QUEUE` as success, swallowed child failures, contained stale or wrong
integration wiring, and produced no caption-matching direct-native receipt.
They remain rollback evidence only. Reusable creative responsibilities are the
Larry fixed-string slide composition, 14-day anti-repeat, image normalization,
Instagram PNG-to-JPEG conversion, and retained asset pools. Existing Honne and
Anicca Card JA packs are already migrated; copying them again is prohibited.

The current hook chooser is LRU rotation, not self-improvement. Metrics and
reward are not chooser inputs; `preferred` is not consumed as a winner; no
keep/revert decision changes the next generation; and the static
`honne_en_base_20260823` campaign token has been shared by eleven hooks. MKT-12A0
is therefore invalid as a causal hook cohort and is reopened after recovery.

Host-wide disk exhaustion was a concurrent safety blocker: the Data volume had
about 266 MiB available at 100% utilization, ordinary writes returned `ENOSPC`,
and several publication logs contained both space and ledger failures.
MKT-09R0 removed only regeneration-safe bun/npm/browser/Codex dependency and
user cache contents, restoring `1,610,212 KiB` available. The content-object and
local-ledger suite passes 20/20; a fresh isolated write below the LM data root
returned object bytes equal, first enqueue `created=true`, replay
`created=false`, and an intact queued job readback. The probe was then deleted.
No LM evidence/state/object pack or OpenClaw file was removed and no provider
adapter ran. Re-download is the recovery path for the removed cache contents.

MKT-09R1 now enforces the recovery fence at the shared local-ledger boundary,
so every cycle using `marketing.video.publish` is checked both before a new
publication enqueue and before an existing queued effect claim. The explicit
LM state file is mode `0600` and `closed`; a future `open` state must name the
one exact allowed effect key. A real Honne EN cycle for the next 07:00 JST slot
created one generation receipt, then durably refused publication job
`marketing-video-publication:7184e3bdde21ee6fd2bfd520ad61585048ebedf3c14ef6a9905ea917bddbe904`
at enqueue. Before/after/replay counts stayed publication jobs `42`, Telegram
jobs `140`, and Postiz window rows `16`; generation moved once from `53` to
`54` and then stayed `54`. Two refusal readbacks are mode `0600`; no job was
loaded, stopped, restarted, unloaded, enabled, deleted, or kickstarted. TDD
proved the missing behavior RED twice, then the focused fence tests pass 2/2,
the full local-ledger suite 20/20, and the affected cycle/canary suite 26/26.

MKT-09R2 repairs the JP4 caption-collision incident without a provider effect.
Postiz caption-only preflight reuse now fails closed unless the row carries the
exact video digest, and both distribution reuse and TikTok metric discovery
assign one provider row/native URL to its first media lineage. The first JP4
effect remains `published` at provider row `cmt5exlqb00cjqk0yu6q2xftc` and
`https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp4/video/7677106804039355656`; TikTok oEmbed
returned account `@anicca.jp4` and caption `心を整える5つの言葉`, while its fresh
thumbnail visually matched first object `35a15c7c…9a15` (woman at a laptop,
hook `怠けてるんじゃない。脳が限界なだけ。`) and contradicted second object
`7e24db96…9ae9` (different person and hook). The second publication job and its
dependent Telegram `30370` receipt are now terminal `conflict`, each retaining
the superseded receipt in append-only history; the correct Telegram `29982`
and first publication receipt are unchanged. The correction added exactly two
job and two receipt events, replay added `0/0`, and metrics discovery returns
one row for the native URL. Focused RED 4 then GREEN 4/4; full Python 50/50 and
Node 44/44 pass. No Postiz/TikTok/Telegram write or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-01 reconciles Honne JA effect `b9b21411…917c` as `present` without a
new effect. Its exact lineage is slot `2026-08-22T23:30:00.000Z`, creative
`HJA-013-ed3318c496f4`, video `ed3318c4…fcb6`, and caption `ママに「好きにすれば」って
言われた時の正解`. Postiz row `cmt50gsr706qnqp0yak91fvvn` matched the
integration, caption, and time but exposed only a profile URL and internal
suffix `7677000652719114257`; TikTok oEmbed rejected that suffix with HTTP 400.
The profile readback exposed candidate `7677002249733786896`; official oEmbed
then returned `@honnevideo`, the exact caption, and the direct canonical URL,
while its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact video object's first
frame. Reconciliation appended one job and one receipt event, replay appended
`0/0`, and the same Postiz window remained four rows. No Telegram or provider
write and no legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-02 reconciles Honne EN effect `0b1f8c3f…9784` as `present` without a
new effect. Exact lineage is slot `2026-08-23T02:00:00.000Z`, creative
`HEN-007-154a1508e0a8`, video `154a1508…d36e`, and caption `the dev who built
this deserves a medal`. Postiz row `cmt55ufo008dlqk0yunxhqmlb` matched exact
integration/caption/time but its internal suffix `7677041102414923784` failed
official oEmbed with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed direct candidate
`7677041244052131080`; official oEmbed returned `@honne_reveal` and the exact
caption, and its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact video frame and
hook `my friends are actually evil`. Reconciliation events were `1/1`, replay
`0/0`, and the Postiz window remained two rows. No Telegram/provider write or
legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-03 reconciles Honne EN effect `3d52f25e…0fb9` as `present` without a
new effect. Exact lineage is slot `2026-08-23T11:30:00.000Z`, creative
`HEN-008-c8ccd06d2a77`, video `c8ccd06d…f39d5`, and caption `whoever made this
app i love you`. Postiz row `cmt5q6rit02dvqk0yrbnbjwzg` matched the exact
integration/caption/time but its internal suffix `7677186618888996881` failed
official oEmbed with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed direct candidate
`7677187822066961680`; official oEmbed returned `@honne_reveal` and the exact
caption, and its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact video frame and
hook `i am so cooked`. Reconciliation events were `1/1`, replay `0/0`, and the
Postiz window remained two rows. No Telegram/provider write or legacy job
operation ran.

MKT-09R3-04 reconciles Anicca JA effect `50d36c4e…fae0` as `present` without
a new effect. Exact lineage is slot `2026-08-23T22:15:00.000Z`, creative
`AJ-CARD-002-35a15c7ce990`, video `35a15c7c…9a15`, and caption `メンタルが強い人の
口癖５選`. Postiz row `cmt6d84wz0b4nqk0ygs409fcx` was the only exact
integration/caption/time row and exposed only the `@anicca.he` profile plus
internal suffix `7677352047456536593`; official oEmbed rejected that suffix
with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed two caption matches, and TikTok ID
timestamps bound the target slot to `7677353835345595664` at 22:13:55 UTC
rather than the 13-hour-old post. Official oEmbed returned the exact caption
and direct URL, and its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact video frame,
person, laptop, composition, and hook `怠けてるんじゃない。脳が限界なだけ。`.
Reconciliation events were `1/1`, replay `0/0`, and the Postiz window kept
one exact-effect row. No Telegram/provider write or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-05 reconciles Honne EN effect `e97d54e5…663d8` as terminal `absent`,
not success. Exact lineage is slot `2026-08-24T02:00:00.000Z`, creative
`HEN-010-c8ccd06d2a77`, video `c8ccd06d…f39d5`, and caption `someone give
the dev a raise rn`. Postiz row `cmt6l9gk90dkyqk0yrdhao2dh` was the only
exact integration/caption/time row; its stored upload bytes exactly matched the
LM video SHA. However it exposed only the `@honne_reveal` profile and internal
suffix `7677412015358511120`, which official oEmbed rejected with HTTP 400.
The current TikTok browser DOM listed 15 public native videos, yt-dlp exposed
the same recent IDs, and exact-caption search found no target; neither the
caption nor slot had a direct native artifact. The durable receipt therefore
keeps Postiz `PUBLISHED` as provider state but records `status=absent`,
`public_url=unavailable`, and `provider_reconciled=false`. Reconciliation
events were `1/1`, replay `0/0`, and the Postiz window remained one row. No
new effect, provider write, Telegram receipt, or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-06 reconciles Honne JA effect `9cf83b48…8389` as `present` without
a new effect. Exact lineage is slot `2026-08-24T03:30:00.000Z`, creative
`HJA-017-ed3318c496f4`, video `ed3318c4…fcb6`, and caption `「怒ってないよ」の
本音を 翻訳してみた【親編】`. Postiz row `cmt6oh7920nzkqp0yulkbwtfp`
matched exact integration/caption/time but exposed only the `@honnevideo`
profile and internal suffix `7677433871651129360`; official oEmbed rejected
that suffix with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed direct candidate
`7677435198132342033` at 03:29:38 UTC; official oEmbed returned the exact
caption and account, and its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact video
frame and hook `上司の「怒ってないよ」絶対怒ってる`. Reconciliation events were
`1/1`, replay `0/0`, and the Postiz window remained three rows. No
Telegram/provider write or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-07 reconciles Honne EN effect `05024c43…b93a6` as `present` without

integration/caption/time row but exposed only the `@honne_reveal` profile and
internal suffix `7677558829269829649`; official oEmbed rejected that suffix
with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed direct candidate
`7677558878862675201` at 11:29:35 UTC; official oEmbed returned the exact

and internal suffix `7677574085069539344`; official oEmbed rejected that
suffix with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed direct candidate
`7677574370595753232` at 12:29:42 UTC; official oEmbed returned the exact

Reconciliation events were `1/1`, replay `0/0`, and the Postiz window
remained two rows. No Telegram/provider write or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-09 reconciles Honne EN effect `1eacd207…4586e` as `present` without

Telegram/provider write or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-10 closes stale-running Anicca JA effect `8d6553d3…501da` as
`present` without reclaiming or submitting it. Exact lineage is slot
`2026-08-24T23:00:00.000Z`, creative `AJ-CARD-001-7e24db967bf7`, video
`7e24db96…9ae9`, and caption `強い人の口癖、5つだけ`. Postiz row
`cmt7u9up1091mp20yh5fc4zyq` was the only exact integration/caption/time row
but exposed only the `@anicca.jp` profile and internal suffix
`7677736820393920513`; official oEmbed rejected that suffix with HTTP 400.
Profile readback exposed direct candidate `7677736873061551377` at 23:00:17
UTC; official oEmbed returned exact account/caption, and its fresh thumbnail
visually matched the exact object and hook `やらなきゃいけないのに動けない自分が嫌になる`.
Only after readback, the expired external-effect claim returned `null` and
moved `running→reconciling` with lease owner/expiry cleared; resolution then
completed `present`. Job events were `2`, receipt events `1`, replay
`0/0`, and no provider execution or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-11 reconciles Anicca JP4 effect `404ff87a…41741` as `present`
without a new effect. Exact lineage is slot `2026-08-25T06:15:00.000Z`,
creative `AJ-CARD-003-35a15c7ce990`, video `35a15c7c…9a15`, and caption
`強さは静けさから生まれる`. Postiz row `cmt89tbgo0cb1mp0yq9jrw2x1` was the
only exact integration/caption/time row but exposed only the `@anicca.jp4`
profile and internal suffix `7677848455687047185`; official oEmbed rejected
that suffix with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed direct candidate
`7677848633974344977`; official oEmbed returned exact account/caption, and
its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact object and hook `怠けてるんじゃない。
脳が限界なだけ。`. Reconciliation events were `1/1`, replay `0/0`, and the
Postiz window remained two rows. No Telegram/provider write or legacy job
operation ran.

MKT-09R3-12 reconciles delayed Honne EN effect `72454c23…69d45` as `present`
without hiding its schedule miss. Exact lineage is logical slot
`2026-08-25T02:00:00.000Z`, creative `HEN-013-154a1508e0a8`, video
`154a1508…d36e`, and caption `explain this to me like im 5`; the job was not
enqueued until 09:07 UTC. Postiz row `cmt8fyup70dmemp0y83v1lurt` was the only
exact integration/caption row and records actual publish time 09:07 UTC, a
seven-hour delay. Its internal suffix `7677892791749658640` failed official
oEmbed with HTTP 400. Profile readback exposed direct candidate
`7677893103830764816`; official oEmbed returned exact account/caption, and
its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact video and hook
`my friends are actually evil`. The receipt keeps logical `slot=02:00` and
actual `published_at=09:07` separately. Reconciliation events were `1/1`,
replay `0/0`, and no provider write or legacy job operation ran.

MKT-09R3-13 reconciles delayed Honne JA effect `f9aa4089…b5c81` as `present`
and closes the 13-effect recovery set. Exact lineage is logical slot
`2026-08-25T03:30:00.000Z`, creative `HJA-019-ed3318c496f4`, video
`ed3318c4…fcb6`, and caption `彼女に「好きにすれば」って 言われた時の正解`;
the job was not enqueued until 09:07 UTC. Postiz row
`cmt8fz5ry0dbsp20y17m7b366` was the only exact integration/caption row and
records actual publish time 09:07 UTC. Its internal suffix
`7677892935858227216` failed official oEmbed with HTTP 400. Profile readback
exposed direct candidate `7677893274102811920`; official oEmbed returned the
exact account/caption, and its fresh thumbnail visually matched the exact
object and hook `上司の「怒ってないよ」絶対怒ってる`. The receipt keeps logical
slot and actual publish time separate; reconciliation was `1/1`, replay
`0/0`. Across all 13 recovery effects, terminal decisions are 12 `present`
and one `absent`; the full publication ledger is 41 `completed`, one
`conflict`, and zero unknown/running/reconciling jobs. No new provider effect
or legacy job operation ran.

The public GitHub `main` tree contains the current Rockstar_ibot marketing
source, but not the live LM `.env`, ledgers, or object-store MP4s. This audit
does not prove that the full Git history is secret-free. The official Postiz
CLI at fixed commit `77d09c668cb2f7793989a185844d0a0c3d65c951` documents useful
endpoint and payload shapes, but it has no create idempotency or automatic
effect reconciliation, recommends blind create retries, uses a second
credential store, and is AGPL. It is not embedded or invoked. Rockstar_ibot
keeps its own minimal client, durable effect ledger, no automatic POST retry,
and GET-only readback/reconciliation. Third-party Postiz CLIs are rejected.

The read-only legacy inventory confirms that the live OpenClaw scheduler
contains marketing targets but zero enabled marketing targets, and the
corresponding launchd agents are unloaded. The older `cron/jobs.json` is not
the live scheduler inventory: it
retains disabled Larry/ReelClaw rows plus stale enabled bytes for jobs such as
`4.7-slideshow-morning`, whose script hard-codes the Honne JA TikTok integration
for unrelated Anicca slideshow content. Those bytes and old backups prove only
past configuration, not current execution, and must not be revived or copied as
account routing. ReelClaw Widget JA has
inconsistent account mappings, Widget/Card EN lacks an approved hook bank, and
Larry JA/EN lacks a reliable native-artifact verification contract. Life
Manager reuses only the creative responsibilities that survive review — fixed
string slideshow composition, 14-day anti-repeat, normalization, Instagram
PNG-to-JPEG conversion, and approved asset pools. It does not copy the legacy
scheduler, account mappings, wrappers, `postId`/`QUEUE` success logic, or
`|| true` error suppression. No legacy job state changed during this audit.

### 3.3 Historical marketing launch state before quarantine

The table preserves the pre-quarantine schedules for behavior equivalence. Its
`Active` cells are historical observations, not the current launch state. It
lists the revenue-relevant daily families, not every unrelated maintenance job.

| Family | Historical cadence | Historical boundary | Pre-quarantine condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Larry Anicca slideshows | Multiple EN/JA accounts, 1–4 posts per account/day | Profitable Claude wrapper; several scripts return to `~/.openclaw` | Active; some library-post jobs exit 3 |
| ReelClaw Anicca videos | Card/widget EN/JA, 1–2 posts per variant/day | Mostly `~/.openclaw/skills/_dispatcher` and ReelClaw scripts | Active; several jobs exit 1 |
| Honne videos | EN at 07:00/11:00/20:30; JA at 08:30/12:30/21:30 | `~/.openclaw` ReelClaw scripts | Active with recent logs. The JA shadow counterpart was enabled in the local compose stack on 2026-07-30 13:33 JST (worker capabilities generate-only, never `marketing.video.publish`, via a gitignored `deploy/local/compose.override.yaml` outside repo defaults); this was the historical basis for expecting shadow evidence at 12:30/21:30 JST, not proof that the gate is currently accruing |
| Larry strategy learning | 05:10 daily | Reads OpenClaw content metrics and library state | Latest exit 2 |
| Capafy core | 08:10 daily | `/Users/operator/anicca` | Active |
| Capafy goal/marketing | 09:00, 11:20, 16:00 | `/Users/operator/anicca` | Active; latest marketing rows show zero engagement |
| Clipping | Every 86,400 seconds | `/Users/operator/anicca` | Active; latest recorded asset was below quality floor |
| Writer/article | craft train and article resume/daily/learning jobs are loaded; standalone writer daily/learn plists exist but are not currently loaded | Profitable Claude plus local writer CLI | Mixed; loaded jobs include successes and failures |
| Shared marketing metrics | Every 15 minutes | Profitable Claude engine | Runs successfully but has no production ledgers to observe |
| Shared marketing dashboard | Every 15 minutes | Profitable Claude engine | Runs successfully but projects an empty runtime |
| Rockstar_ibot financial report | Every five minutes; send gates at 20:00 daily and Sunday 20:05 weekly | Legacy launchd still reads its historical environment; replacement uses Rockstar_ibot PostgreSQL jobs and tenant secret refs | Replacement real-send proof complete (`message_id=432`); legacy remains active only for shadow/cutover safety |

Immediate Rockstar_ibot marketing routing measured during this design update:

| Route | Scheduler identity | TikTok integration before | TikTok integration after | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current Rockstar_ibot IG + TikTok daily pass | launchd `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-daily`, 10:15 JST | `cmp9txjdp01c8oh0yb6dhlarr` (`@anicca_buddha`) | `cmpc6cr6g00d8lg0yfythzz9f` (`@anicca.comedy`) | Route change is now proven by B01 TikTok `7667934981481875473`; the old launchd remains loaded for the seven-cycle shadow gate |
| Retired OpenClaw wrappers | `6ad526a5-7f2a-4738-930b-89c158acf10d` and `a7e6095c-1472-4408-ae04-e20598b66cbf` | `cmpc6cr6g00d8lg0yfythzz9f` | n/a | Both are classified `disabled` |
| Retired recording-based successor | launchd `ai.anicca.lm-video-post` | `cmpc6cr6g00d8lg0yfythzz9f` | n/a | Service is not loaded, active plist is absent, and control-plane desired state is `disabled` |

The first `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-daily` migration slice is operational:

- Rockstar_ibot imports the exact B01 video, caption, standing approval, and
  Instagram profile into its own data root. Runtime jobs contain only
  content-addressed `object://sha256/...`, tenant profile, integration, and
  secret references.
- Instagram and TikTok are separate durable publication jobs. One broken
  account cannot block the other platform, and a partial effect cannot be
  misreported as a two-platform success.
- TikTok B01 is publicly reachable at
  `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.comedy/video/7667934981481875473`.
  The PostgreSQL job completed on attempt 1 with that raw URL and the exact
  video/caption hashes. Re-enqueue after worker replacement returned
  `created=false`; the provider still contained exactly one matching post.
- Postiz returned a profile URL plus a numeric `releaseId`. The adapter now
  derives and verifies the individual video URL, and reconciles the exact
  recent caption+integration before any upload. A provider success can no
  longer become either a false failure or a duplicate retry.
- The configured Instagram session returns `ChallengeRequired` and remains
  `poisoned_manual_backup`. No IG write was attempted and no unrelated account
  was substituted. Replacing/warming that tenant profile remains required
  before the Instagram shadow counter can start.
- This slice proves portable distribution and restart safety, not creative
  quality or self-improvement. B01 came from the currently retained renderer.

The second `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-daily` migration slice makes generation
portable without enabling a competing scheduler:

- The creative bank, call audio, stock footage, proof image, and Whisper
  transcript were copied once into Rockstar_ibot's private content-addressed
  object store. Generation jobs now carry only those five immutable refs plus
  tenant and date; they read no OpenClaw or other repository path.
- The local Rockstar_ibot worker completed three real render jobs on attempt 1.
  A03 produced a 34.666667-second MP4 with SHA-256
  `35e4084f1aa1349029348c908a5d1f07a0db2c9ded1fe5728fcfd2d69fba0cda`;
  state, lock, and render files are mode `0600`, and the MP4 was imported back
  into the immutable object store.
- Real frame comparison exposed why the old rotation did not create visible
  variation: A01 and A02 had different ledger IDs but byte-identical MP4s and
  no rendered text because the runtime image had no fonts. The image now
  packages fontconfig plus Noto/CJK and the ASS contract names that font.
  A03 has a different MP4 hash, and its decoded frame visibly contains both
  `BEFORE ROCKSTAR_IBOT • A03` and the Japanese hook.
- Rockstar_ibot now has the 10:15 JST generation scheduler contract, but
  `LM_MARKETING_GENERATION_ENABLED` defaults to `false`. It remains disabled
  while the legacy launchd owner is loaded, so this proof cannot create a
  duplicate daily publication.
- This closes portable asset/state/render ownership for this one loop.
  Publication chaining, metric attribution, winner/challenger learning,
  next-run consumption, Telegram marketing reporting, and seven-cycle shadow
  evidence remain open. Autonomous learning still remains frozen until the
  runtime migration gates permit Orders 32–35.

The third slice closes the durable generation→publication handoff without
creating a competing external effect:

- The scheduler scans only one explicit tenant and receipts created on or
  after an explicit cutoff. It accepts only completed, verified
  `marketing_daily_generation` receipts and fans each receipt out into
  independent Instagram and TikTok publication jobs.
- An isolated PostgreSQL proof completed generation attempt 1, found exactly
  one immutable receipt, and created exactly two queued publication jobs:
  Instagram 1 and TikTok 1. Replaying the same scan returned
  `created=false,false`; the database still contained three total jobs
  (generation 1 plus publication 2) and one generation receipt.
- The proof database was dropped after verification. The live local database
  contains zero A03 publication jobs, so this slice made no provider call and
  created no duplicate post.
- `LM_MARKETING_PUBLICATION_CHAIN_ENABLED` defaults to `false`, historical
  backfill has no implicit default, and the legacy
  `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-daily` LaunchAgent remains loaded
  (`runs=1`, `last exit code=1`). This is a handoff/idempotency proof, not a
  cutover or a claim that Instagram is repaired.

The fourth slice repairs the Rockstar_ibot-owned Instagram profile without
posting or modifying the legacy source:

- Browser authorization reached Instagram home after dismissing the provider's
  automated-behavior warning, and the authenticated profile link was exactly
  `/anicca.affirms2/`. No different logged-in browser account was accepted as
  evidence.
- The Rockstar_ibot-owned saved session then passed a read-only feed probe,
  launcher probe, and `account_info` identity check for `anicca.affirms2`.
  Recovery atomically changed only that tenant profile row from
  `poisoned_manual_backup` to `ready`, removed the poison fields, preserved file
  mode `0600`, and recorded `recovered_at`.
- A subsequent read-only verification returned `ok=true`, 12 Reels, including
  `/anicca.affirms2/reel/DbPPpXCMjrf/` and
  `/anicca.affirms2/reel/DbKkdfjsaTZ/`. This proves session and account parity;
  it does not claim a new publication.
- A mismatched authenticated username now fails closed: it cannot refresh the
  saved settings or recover the profile. A `ChallengeRequired` remains a
  quarantine event; the private API never retries a password login.
- The legacy `~/.cloak` account row remains
  `poisoned_manual_backup`, the publication chain remains disabled, and
  `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-daily` remains loaded. No external post or scheduler
  cutover occurred in this slice.

The fifth slice establishes truthful publication measurement without activating
a competing scheduler or claiming unavailable data as zero:

- Every new distribution result carries the provider's post ID and route into
  the immutable publication receipt. Historical receipts remain verifiable but
  cannot be observed unless those join keys already exist; immutable history is
  never rewritten.
- Each publication is observed independently. Deterministic, reference-only
  jobs are created only when its 2h, 24h, 72h, or 7d window is due. Repeated
  scheduler scans rely on the durable job ID for idempotency and cannot create
  duplicate observations.
- An isolated PostgreSQL proof scanned one completed publication receipt,
  created four due observation jobs on the first pass and zero on the second
  (`true,true,true,true` then `false,false,false,false`). A real worker claim
  completed all four controlled-empty observations as `insufficient` with
  `views=null` and `reward.effect=no_change`; the proof database was then
  removed.
- The observation receipt preserves product, creative, platform, clickable
  public URL, provider ID/route, video/caption hashes, exact window timestamps,
  platform metrics, product metrics, and reward eligibility. A measured zero is
  valid; a missing, delayed, unsupported, or unattributed metric remains
  `value=null` with a controlled reason.
- Postiz's per-post analytics route is wired for views, likes, comments, and
  shares. The current product-metric provider truthfully reports
  `attribution_not_configured` until App Store Connect, RevenueCat/product
  analytics, and proceeds sources are added.
- A read-only check of the real B01 TikTok post could not obtain metrics:
  TikTok blocked the direct downloader from the current IP, and Postiz returned
  an empty analytics array. Therefore B01's current measured state is
  unavailable, not zero, and it causes no learning change.
- `LM_MARKETING_OBSERVATION_ENABLED` defaults to `false` and requires an
  explicit tenant, product, cutoff, and worker capability. The existing
  LaunchAgent is unchanged; no post, message, credential mutation, or scheduler
  cutover occurred in this slice.

The sixth slice begins the shared Larry/ReelClaw producer migration with the
measured working Honne JA path and no external effect:

- The one-time importer copied 24 Honne JA hooks and four verified MP4 files
  into the Rockstar_ibot data root and immutable object store. Its runtime
  manifest contains only tenant/product/format/locale IDs and
  `object://sha256/...` refs; generation never reads `~/.openclaw` or
  Profitable Claude.
- The generic `marketing.video.generate` adapter is product-, format-, locale-,
  and tenant-scoped. It chooses the least-recent active hook from the imported
  prior-use state plus durable Rockstar_ibot receipts and rotates media
  deterministically by schedule slot.
- An isolated PostgreSQL worker proof enqueued one Honne JA job, completed one
  immutable `marketing_video_artifact` receipt, selected `HJA-007`, and emitted
  content-addressed video and copy refs. Re-enqueue returned `created=false`;
  the database remained at one job and one receipt.
- This adapter is a no-effect producer. It did not call Postiz, Instagram,
  TikTok, or YouTube. The existing `ai.anicca.reelclaw-honne-ja` LaunchAgent
  remains loaded at 12:30 and 21:30. Its current launchctl process counters
  were reset by a later service reload (`runs=0`, never exited); the schedule
  and legacy owner remain intact and were not cut over by this slice.
- Measured Larry and Anicca ReelClaw paths are not silently promoted: their
  current logs include missing media/hook/API inputs and non-zero exits. Each
  gets its own repair, import, shadow, and seven-expected-run proof after the
  working Honne slice.

The seventh slice wires Honne JA generic video scheduling into the Life
Manager scheduler in shadow mode with no external effect:

- `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/honne-ja-shadow-schedule.js` encodes exactly the
  legacy `ai.anicca.reelclaw-honne-ja` cadence — `StartCalendarInterval` 12:30
  and 21:30 Asia/Tokyo, verified read-only via `plutil` — as exact-instant
  schedule slots, and `runSchedulerOwner` gained a Honne JA shadow scan behind
  `LM_HONNE_JA_SHADOW_ENABLED`. The flag defaults to `false`, only the
  deliberate exact value `true` enables it, and it is enabled nowhere; the
  legacy LaunchAgent remains the loaded production owner.
- A manual one-shot trigger (`scripts/honne-ja-shadow-cycle.js run`) executed
  one real shadow cycle against the running local durable store on 2026-07-30.
  The one-time importer copied the 24 Honne JA hooks and four MP4s into the
  runtime data volume (pack `object://sha256/609d5414…`), and the cycle
  enqueued and completed generation job
  `marketing-video-generation:0f19ddbb…` for slot `2026-07-30T03:30:00.000Z`
  through the same `createWorkerHandlers`/`executeCapabilityJob` worker path
  as the HJA-007 proof. It selected `HJA-008` — the least-recent active hook
  after HJA-007 in the imported prior-use state — and emitted lineage whose
  `video_sha256`
  (`7658b8130ff2e750a143bd09462d11c30ace49d06aa587754bd088f27399165f`) equals
  the legacy `v2.mp4` SHA-256 byte for byte.
- The chained Instagram and TikTok publication jobs were enqueued durably and
  HELD: both remain `queued`, a durable hold row with status `shadow_held`
  records their job IDs, no worker holds the `marketing.video.publish`
  capability in shadow, and no Instagram, TikTok, or Postiz call occurred. A
  replay of the same slot returned `created=false` for all three jobs, claimed
  zero jobs, and appended no duplicate hold row.
- `scripts/honne-ja-shadow-status.js` reads the durable store and reports the
  count of consecutive EXPECTED 12:30/21:30 JST slots with exactly one
  verified shadow generation receipt each against the §13 seven-expected-run
  gate; expected slots that passed without a receipt row reset the count and
  are reported as `missed_slots`, and duplicate receipts for one slot also
  reset. No ownership cutover occurred and none is claimed.

The historical OpenClaw JSON store contains enabled entries for Larry,
ReelClaw, app reviews, Capafy publishing, CFO sync, and other jobs. The current
SQLite scheduler supersedes that JSON snapshot and has no enabled relevant
marketing row; stale configuration is never treated as a running owner without
a current run receipt.

### 3.4 Evidence and inference are separate

**Evidence:** launchd logs show real posts and executions; the shared marketing
runtime has no ledgers.

**Inference:** repetition is not primarily a prompt-quality problem. The
production generators cannot consume learned weights that were never produced
from attributed observations.

**Evidence:** the existing financial report is based on a wallet ledger and API
cost ledger.

**Inference:** it is an agent-economy P&L report, not yet a personal net-worth
or whole-business financial-health report.

## 5. Alternatives considered

| Approach | Strength | Fatal weakness | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Railway-only monolith | Simple deployment and multi-user SaaS | API, scheduler, browser, rendering, and posting contend for one failure and scaling boundary | Rejected |
| Local-only Rockstar_ibot | Maximum privacy and simplest first migration | Lights-out, earthquakes, and machine failure stop production; cannot host thousands of tenants | Supported deployment, not the default |
| Cloud-only Rockstar_ibot | Always on and commercially scalable | Blocks the required safe migration path and excludes privacy/self-hosting users | Rejected as the only mode |
| Permanent split runtime where cloud requires a local worker | Reuses local browser sessions | Cloud uptime still depends on the user's machine | Rejected |
| One portable runtime with local and cloud deployment adapters | Removes OpenClaw first, preserves self-hosting, then adds always-on scale without rewriting loop logic | Requires strict adapter contracts and parity tests | Selected |

The local process is the only required deployment for this incident and must be
OpenClaw-free. A hosted profile is a later adapter exercise; it may add managed
availability, tenant isolation, and horizontal worker scaling, but it is not
allowed to change local business logic or become a reason to start a container
or database now. Codex may submit local commands through the CLI, but scheduled
work must be owned by the Rockstar_ibot process itself.

### 6.1 Canonical repository layout

This section is the only SSOT for the program-wide repository layout. The
Agent Economy ownership overlay, wallet/payment-provider boundaries, live
earnings attribution, and financial-independence stages are owned by
[`2026-07-19-anicca-one-repo-consolidation-spec.md`](./2026-07-19-anicca-one-repo-consolidation-spec.md).

The repository boundary is exact:

```text
GitHub SSOT:  Daisuke134/life-manager       (repository ID 1248111245)
legacy only:  Daisuke134/life-manager-v0    (repository ID 1273052304)
```

All new canonical code and operating specifications live in the active Life
Manager monorepo. The target layout extends its existing conventions:

```text
apps/
  rockstar_ibot/             # API, panel, Telegram, reports, cloud scheduler
adapters/                   # provider/transport boundaries
runtime/                    # portable scheduler and worker runtime
services/                   # deployable long-running services
skills/                     # generalized capabilities, never product credentials
packages/
  loop-core/
  job-protocol/
  runtime-adapters/
  finance-engine/
  marketing-engine/
  connector-contracts/
  product-packs/
    anicca-ios/
    honne-ai/
deploy/
  local/
    process/                  # direct local process launchers (required path)
  hosted/                    # deferred; not used by incident recovery
docs/
  migrations/
    life-manager-v0/        # signed file/behavior disposition and equivalence evidence
  superpowers/
    specs/                  # program/design SSOT
    plans/                  # ordered executable slices
```

`life-manager-v0` files are not copied blindly into a second top-level product.
All 35 tracked files are classified behavior-by-behavior; missing required
behavior is zero, the README is redirect-only, and the repository is archived.
Local checkout names are never runtime inputs: jobs use installed release/data
roots rather than either absolute checkout name.

The actual implementation follows existing repository conventions instead of
forcing this exact folder shape where it would create churn. Responsibility
boundaries and single-repository ownership are mandatory even if paths differ.
The checked-in `deploy/local/compose.yaml` and its `runtime-up` wrapper are
historical prototype artifacts only; they are not the incident startup path and
must not be invoked for recovery.

### 6.2 Job protocol

Every action is a durable job:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `job_id` | globally unique idempotency key |
| `tenant_id` | owner boundary |
| `loop_id` | finance, marketing, writer, gig, or another registered loop |
| `capability` | collect, research, generate, render, publish, observe, learn, report |
| `worker_pool` | api, browser, media, publish, observe, learn, or report |
| `resource_class` | cpu/memory/gpu/browser requirements used for placement |
| `deployment_id` | local or cloud runtime that owns the lease |
| `input_refs` | immutable `object://` or local-file references, never embedded secrets |
| `lease_owner`, `lease_until` | single-writer worker claim |
| `attempt`, `max_attempts` | bounded retry |
| `effect_class` | read, draft, publish, money |
| `status` | queued, leased, succeeded, failed, dead-lettered |
| `receipt_ref` | immutable evidence of the real effect |

Workers advertise capabilities and heartbeat. The scheduler never knows
whether a worker is local or cloud, nor whether the implementation is Claude,
Codex, Hermes, or deterministic code. OpenClaw is not an adapter or fallback.

### 6.3 Runtime adapter contract

| Interface | Local implementation (required now) | Hosted implementation (deferred) |
|---|---|---|
| State/ledger | Rockstar_ibot-owned append-only JSONL and atomic files | optional hosted database adapter |
| Queue/leases | filesystem claim/lease files with atomic rename | provider-managed claim protocol |
| Objects | local filesystem under `LM_DATA_DIR` | optional object storage |
| Secrets | OS keychain or guarded Rockstar_ibot env file | tenant-scoped cloud vault |
| Browser profile | encrypted local profile under the Rockstar_ibot data root | encrypted tenant-scoped cloud profile |
| Scheduler | direct Rockstar_ibot local process | the same scheduler contract in a hosted process |
| Workers | local child processes or OS-supervised processes | hosted worker pool |
| Observability | local logs/receipts in the data root and panel/Telegram projections | centralized hosted logs/receipts |

Business logic may depend only on these interfaces. It may not branch on
OpenClaw paths, machine usernames, or repository locations. Migration tests
run with `~/.openclaw` inaccessible.

### 6.4 Multi-tenant execution rules

| Concern | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| Isolation | every job, object, secret, browser profile, artifact, and receipt carries `tenant_id`; authorization fails closed |
| Fairness | tenant queues use weighted fair scheduling; one tenant cannot consume every worker |
| Limits | per-tenant publish, browser, rendering, spend, and connector rate limits |
| Idempotency | scheduler retries may create attempts, never duplicate external effects |
| Browser state | encrypted, tenant-scoped cloud profiles; ephemeral execution containers; no shared cookies |
| Scaling | each worker pool scales independently from queue depth and job age |
| Recovery | leases expire; another eligible worker in the same deployment reconciles before retrying an unknown effect |

Local mode keeps the same `tenant_id` boundary even for a single user. This
prevents local-only shortcuts from breaking later cloud migration.

### 6.5 Connector contract

Every source implements:

```text
connect() -> authorization state
sync(cursor) -> immutable source events + next cursor
health() -> freshness, last success, actionable error
normalize(events) -> canonical ledger rows
```

Initial connectors:

| Domain | Connectors |
|---|---|
| Cash and net worth | Moneytree LINK, manual balance, exchange/wallet read-only APIs |
| Mobile apps | App Store Connect Analytics/Sales, Mixpanel, and product-pack metric inputs |
| Web products | Stripe |
| Autonomous income | uGig, Capafy, clipping affiliate, writer, x402, bounty |
| Distribution | TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, X through OAuth/API where available and isolated cloud-browser adapters where necessary |

An unavailable connector returns `unavailable` with its last successful
snapshot. It never returns a fabricated zero.

## 7. Financial-health model

### 7.1 Canonical statements

| Statement | Contents |
|---|---|
| Personal balance sheet | cash, investments, crypto, receivables, liabilities, net worth |
| Daily cash flow | money in, money out, transfers, fees, realized gains/losses |
| Business P&L | revenue, refunds, platform fees, API/compute/ad costs, contribution profit by business |
| Recurring revenue | MRR, active paid, trials, new MRR, expansion, contraction, churn |
| Liquidity and risk | runway, tax reserve, emergency reserve, concentration, stale sources |

Every amount stores original currency, original amount, FX rate source,
converted amount, and timestamp. Transfers are excluded from income. Unrealized
asset appreciation is separated from earned business income.

### 7.2 Business dimensions

Initial business keys are:

`life_manager`, `anicca_ios`, `honne_ai`, `gig_work`, `capafy`,
`clipping_affiliate`, `writer`, `nisa`, `crypto_yield`,
`crypto_trading`, `x402`, and `bounty`.

The list is data, not code. Users can add products and businesses without a
deployment.

### 7.3 Telegram financial report

Agent Economy revenue attribution and live amounts MUST come from
[`2026-07-19-anicca-one-repo-consolidation-spec.md` §0.4](./2026-07-19-anicca-one-repo-consolidation-spec.md#04-agent-economy-earnings-ssot).
Unverified income, self-pay, seed capital, and principal recovery MUST NOT be
rendered as revenue; unavailable amounts render as `$0.00` or `unavailable`.

Daily report time defaults to 20:00 in the user's timezone, after the existing
financial-report convention. Each tenant can configure a different report
time; no second scheduler or report contract is created.

### 7.4 Telegram UI/UX

Telegram is the daily command surface; the web panel is the detailed system of
record. The bot sends one scheduled digest per health domain plus
exception-only alerts, rather than narrating every background job.

The daily set is:

| Report | Core fields |
|---|---|
| Financial Health | net worth, cash, runway, income, costs, profit, MRR, source freshness, material deltas |
| Physical Health | sleep duration/quality, HR/HRV when available, steps/activity, recovery trend, one highest-leverage action |

### 8.2 What is shared and what is isolated

| Shared across products | Isolated per product/channel/audience |
|---|---|
| job protocol, ledgers, experiment controller, canary/revert, dashboards, connector interfaces | promise, proof, offer, forbidden claims, hook weights, format library, platform account, locale, attribution, reward |

This prevents an Anicca hook winner from silently changing Honne output.

### 8.3 Format DNA

The engine learns structure, not verbatim creative:

| Slice | Examples |
|---|---|
| Hook | confession, contradiction, threat, curiosity gap, specific outcome |
| Narrative | problem–agitation–proof, before/after, demo, reaction, list |
| Visual grammar | first-frame text density, cuts, slide count, product reveal timing |
| Audio | voice, music energy, silence, sound-effect timing |
| CTA | install, comment, save, trial, direct proof |

Each format records source URL, observed date, public metrics, extracted
structure, allowed reuse, and similarity fingerprints. Copyrighted assets are
not copied into the product.

### 8.4 Variation gates

A candidate fails before rendering when:

1. Its normalized hook equals a hook used by the same account in the recent
   exclusion window.
2. Semantic similarity to a recent hook exceeds the configured product limit.
3. The same format family would exceed its rolling share cap.
4. Product proof, locale, platform, or CTA does not match the product pack.
5. The visual checksum or transcript is effectively a duplicate.

Variation is measured, not requested with a prompt.

### 8.5 Reward hierarchy

| Horizon | Signal | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 2 hours | valid publication, views, first-frame hold | detect delivery or creative failure |
| 24 hours | hold, completion, saves, profile/product clicks | rank hooks and formats |
| 72 hours | attributed installs and activated users | promote acquisition winners |
| 7–35 days | trials, paid users, proceeds, retention | promote revenue winners |

The optimizer uses the deepest available reward. Views cannot override a
measured loss in paid conversion. Missing revenue remains unknown rather than
zero.

### 8.6 Anicca and Honne product packs

| Pack | Required proof |
|---|---|
| Anicca iOS | notification/Nudge experience, actual intervention outcomes, supported problem types, real paywall and price |
| Honne AI | real product demo, language-matched assets, actual transformation, real store/paywall path |

Each pack owns JA and EN audiences separately. Existing Larry and ReelClaw
producers become adapters behind the same artifact/publication contracts.

**2026-08-21 asset-lineage correction.** The legacy asset inventory was read
without starting any legacy job. The retained mobile mapping is:

| Product | Approved legacy family | Locale/media family | Destination rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Honne AI | ReelClaw Honne demo | `honne-en` / `honne-ja` | TikTok only; EN `@honne_reveal`, JA `@honnevideo` |
| Anicca iOS | Larry slideshow plus ReelClaw card/widget | Larry account variants; `card-en/ja`; `widget-en/ja` | only the current Rockstar_ibot lane manifest assignments |

The `lm_wake_EN.mp4` and `lm_wake_JA.mp4` files are Rockstar_ibot wake/demo
artifacts, not one of these mobile marketing packs. They must not be selected
for Honne or Anicca iOS publication. A one-time migration may copy a legacy
pack into the Rockstar_ibot object store, but the runtime must resolve only
object references under `LM_DATA_DIR` and never read the legacy directory,
environment, or scheduler.

The one-time local import now exists for both Honne locales: EN pack
`object://sha256/0c28dee02059c6853c614c897bb8d47820aeeaa951432c8953577d8cde617706`
with media `de63fa6b…`, `c8ccd06d…`, `154a1508…`, and JA pack
`object://sha256/d550a0a6732134ea23292818f3cf389db6f31d6ad699652c9eccb7b6a92486ab`
with media `b11d8841…`, `7658b813…`, `ced745f2…`, `ed3318c4…`. These refs
are local evidence only; no OpenClaw path is part of the runtime contract.

### 8.7 Measured state of the shared marketing engine (2026-07-30)

Everything below was read off the running system, not inferred. It supersedes any
earlier statement that Postiz was cancelled.

**Current recheck (2026-08-20 JST).** Postiz still answers
`connected=true`; 28 of 29 integrations are enabled and all four target
Anicca/Honne TikTok integrations are enabled. The target accounts received zero
new Postiz submissions from 2026-08-01 through 2026-08-20. The stop is upstream:
the legacy schedulers are quarantined and the Rockstar_ibot replacement is not
running. Postiz subscription and API authentication are therefore eliminated
as the proximate cause; TikTok-side publishing credentials remain unverified
until a controlled canary. The historical engine details
below remain useful for migration equivalence, but their launch-state claims are
not current.

**Local-runtime correction for this incident.** The preceding portable/cloud
design text is not an instruction to start Docker, Colima, Railway, or
PostgreSQL. The recovery control plane is a direct local Rockstar_ibot process
with Rockstar_ibot-owned append-only JSONL ledgers and atomic filesystem
claims/receipts under `LM_DATA_DIR` (default
`~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot`). MKT-01 now owns the I-3 claim/receipt/replay
boundary through this local ledger: live/dead lock ownership is fail-closed,
partial JSONL tails recover without accepting mid-file corruption, heartbeat
markers survive crash ordering, and expired external effects enter
`reconciling`/`unknown_effect` instead of retrying a possibly-posted effect.
The old SQL/`pg` path is not used by this incident runtime. No OpenClaw path,
env file, asset, or state may be read.

**Distribution actually in use.** `GET api.postiz.com/public/v1/integrations` returns
**29 live integrations** (16 TikTok, 7 Instagram, 3 YouTube, 1 X). `anicca-larry`'s
`post-to-tiktok.js` posts through that API with `POSTIZ_API_KEY`. Instagram
additionally has an agent-owned fallback lane (account created by
`ig-account-create`, posted by `marketing-engine/poster.py` over instagrapi).
**Decision: keep Postiz as the primary provider for this recovery and do not
schedule a Postiz exit.** Cutting it now would strand the existing accounts. Any
future local replacement is optional and must pass a separate provider
parity/cutover gate; it is not a reason to read OpenClaw or re-enable legacy jobs.
The fallback remains evidence of historical operation, not a new production owner.

**How shared the engine really is.** One provisioning path is genuinely shared; the
posting and config paths are not yet:

| Component | clip | capafy | rockstar_ibot |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provision_prompt.sh` | yes (`clip_pass.sh:14`) | yes (`capafy-ig-marketing-daily.sh:17`) | — |
| `load_manifest.sh` | **no** | yes (`:19-20`) | — |
| `poster.py` | **no** (own instagrapi call in `run.sh`) | yes (`capafy-goal-monitor.sh:35`) | — |
| `run_agent.sh` | — | yes | yes (`rockstar_ibot-dev-d0.sh:11`) |

**Why every post looked identical.** The library was scraped once (2026-05-28, 68 EN
rows) under a "scrape once, generate forever" rule, and `fixed-strings-larry-en-v1.json`
pins the hook, the CTA and a single static background for all seven slides.

**The money baseline, read live from RevenueCat on 2026-07-31:** MRR **$20**, 5 active
subscriptions, **0 active trials**, $3 revenue and 230 new customers over 28 days
against 275 active users. Zero trials is the first thing to explain — the funnel is
not short of traffic ideas, it is short of a trial anyone starts. Reaching $10k at the
observed ~$4 blended price needs ~2,500 subscriptions, so the gap is 500×, and at
eight new customers a day no creative test is statistically readable yet.

**What the loop can now see.** `measure/collect_metrics.py` writes one daily row from
RevenueCat, Stripe and the App Store analytics API (Apple builds those reports
asynchronously; the Anicca iOS request already lists 50 available reports). A source
that fails is stored with its error, never as a zero, and a run that reaches no money
source at all exits non-zero. `measure/collect_post_metrics.py` fills the gap that
made scoring impossible: 797 posts in `account-history.jsonl` had `views_6h/24h/48h`
all null. Postiz returns no engagement, and its stored TikTok `releaseURL` is only the
profile (`https://www.tiktok.com/@handle`), which is why `postURLs` answered 400.
The numeric suffix inside `releaseId` is not a native TikTok video ID. The current
adapter therefore refuses to turn it into a direct URL; it must match a public
profile/caption/time readback before a publication receipt is reported. If that
readback is unavailable, the effect remains `unknown` and is never retried as a
new post. TikTok metrics still require provider/profile collection; Instagram uses
its real post URL. First real readings: 557, 189, 74 and 0 views.

**A quarter of the output was disappearing.** The same window shows 106 posts, 83
PUBLISHED and **23 in ERROR state — 22 of them on the "Anicca" TikTok account** — with
nothing anywhere surfacing it.

**Scoring exists but stays silent until it can be honest.** `brain/score.py` ranks
0.6·views + 0.4·engagement (the skill-autoshorts formula) with two guards that
implementation lacks: a post under 24h is not judged, and a cohort under ten posts
produces no verdict at all. Run today: 3 judged posts → `insufficient_data`, no winner
declared.

**Posts were going to accounts that no longer exist (found 2026-07-31).** The TikTok
account behind the "Anicca" integration, `@aniccaen2`, does not exist: Apify answers
"This profile/hashtag does not exist" across three runs while `@aniccajp` returns
videos in the same call, and every "PUBLISHED" post on that integration carries only a
profile URL, never a `/video/` URL. The ten-day pattern is a flat 6 PUBLISHED + 6 ERROR
per day (83/68), so English larry output was not half-failing — it was going nowhere.
Auditing all fifteen enabled TikTok integrations found two more dead targets,
`@anicca.jp8` and `@anicca.jpx`. Six launchd jobs were repointed to verified-alive
accounts (larry-en-v1 to `@aniccaaffirmation`, whose latest video has **253,700 views**
and which no loop was feeding), and `measure/audit_accounts.py` now runs at 06:30,
alerts, and exits non-zero while any target is dead. The three dead integrations still
exist in Postiz and should be deleted or re-provisioned as agent-owned accounts.

**Telegram historically proved three delivery tiers.** A per-post message with the
tappable public URL every 30 minutes (7 real sends, rerun sent 0, proving dedupe), a
daily money digest at 22:00, and a weekly review on Sundays that names accounts to cut
or feed. Raw logs appear in none of them. The current notifier observes zero posts and
sends zero publication messages, so the replacement must alert when an expected slot
is missed. TikTok messages must use a native direct video URL verified by
provider/profile readback, never a profile URL or a numeric `releaseId` suffix alone.

**The ebook can be bought.** The 401 was an expired *test* key; the live key answers
200. Product, a $19 price, a payment link (checkout HTTP 200) and a post-purchase
redirect to a PDF that returns HTTP 200 / application/pdf / 74,424 bytes are live.
Note `dev` deploys only to a Netlify preview, so delivery files must reach `main`.

**Closed on 2026-07-30.**
- `build-from-fixed-strings.sh` now fails at the real cause: a missing background or a
  blank slide text stops the build instead of surfacing three steps later as a node
  ENOENT. Verified by running all three cases.
- `marketing-engine/mine/` mines one niche per day (`mine_daily.sh`, rotating, Apify
  free tier) and `freshness_gate.sh` fails when the newest scrape is older than 48h.
  Verified: gate FAILed before mining, monk-wisdom went 68 → 173 cards, the launchd
  run rotated to honne-relationship (79 → 179) and exited 0.

**Incident I-1 implementation.** Rockstar_ibot now has a separate
`marketing-liveness` process, independent of the marketing scheduler it
observes. It evaluates only explicitly `production-armed` lanes, walks the
most recent 100 expected local-time slots after each lane's grace period, and
turns each slot into one deterministic `message` job. Disabled, default-off,
and shadow lanes create no job. A success requires the generic publication
adapter's verified receipt plus `provider_reconciled=true`; its Telegram body
uses the direct TikTok `/video/<id>` or Instagram artifact URL. A missing or
unreconciled publication reports `status=missed`, `public URL=unavailable`, and
`retry state=unavailable`, never zero or success. The runtime job/effect key is
the durable notification dedupe boundary, and worker execution rebinds every
reference before resolving the tenant-scoped Telegram token and chat. Fake
transport, replay, off-lane, long-lived schedule, JSONB round-trip, per-lane
receipt ranking, runtime wiring, and independent-service tests pass. The four
changed runtime paths pass the legacy dependency scanner with zero violations.
The repository-wide scanner now passes with zero violations: the Connector
photo transport stages its temporary file beneath the validated Rockstar_ibot
data root instead of `.openclaw/media`. The change preserves the provider
transport and removes the last repository-wide legacy-path finding.

### 8.8 Platform and account matrix

Postiz remains the publishing control plane for the recovery. The old
2026-06-03 Postiz map is historical evidence only (it listed 30 integrations);
the live registry is authoritative and must be refreshed by MKT-02. Life
Manager must never read the OpenClaw map, credentials, or assets at runtime.

| Product/channel | TikTok | Instagram | YouTube | Current truth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Honne EN | `@honne_reveal` (`cmoig11ew001zlv0yk6vqo1us`) | **unassigned** — no live Honne Instagram profile in the 2026-08-21 registry | **not used** | TikTok only until an explicit live Instagram assignment exists |
| Honne JA | `@honnevideo` (`cmnit95mg015rrm0ye5vm8dhl`) | **unassigned** — no live Honne Instagram profile in the 2026-08-21 registry | **not used** | TikTok only until an explicit live Instagram assignment exists |
| Anicca JP4 | `@anicca.jp4` (`cmn8x8hdv028uqx0y4gdfse5t`) | not frozen | no dedicated target recorded | one lane at a time |
| Anicca iOS / main JA | `@anicca.jp` (`cmp9sdev5012voh0y58qs45xc`) | `@anicca.jp1` (`cmn8ycvtn02djqx0ytuisn9mw`) | `@anicca-jp` (`cmn1oukj9012nnq0yqhouc3ib`) skipped by owner instruction, LM lane disabled | TikTok/Instagram only; YouTube remains 0/day |
| Anicca EN / main | not in the incident canary | `@anicca.encards` (`cmpc3gx4001nklg0y27a8o66q`) | live candidate `@anicca-ai` (`cmq3u37gi005iqp0y90a2w92n`), LM lane disabled | EN Card Instagram is classified at 0/day; separate pack remains to import |
| Affirmation pack | not an Anicca iOS lane | not an Anicca iOS lane | historical candidate `@anicca-affirmation-video` (`cmn8ymq6c02oio70y5ea1trv8`) | do not mix rewards |

#### 8.8.1 Target account, creative, and cadence contract

This is the intended production portfolio for the two current mobile apps. It
does not arm a lane. The current scheduled cadence is **zero posts per day on
every row** while the incident gates remain open. After that exact row passes a
canary, exact Postiz/local-lineage proof, replay, and metric-source gate, Rockstar_ibot may arm
only the target cadence shown here. The daily limit is per destination account,
not a command to fan every creative out to every connected Postiz integration.

Owner-directed API success rule: for these selected Postiz routes, publication
success is the exact Postiz API row in `PUBLISHED` state plus matching LM
account, integration, platform, creative, locally stored media bytes/order, and
caption lineage. A direct native URL is retained when available and useful, but
TikTok indexing, oEmbed, browser login, or a caption-bearing native page is not
a publication blocker and is never required before continuing other executable
work. Postiz profile URLs or numeric suffixes alone still do not prove identity;
they pass only as fields on the already exact row bound to the LM effect.

#### 8.8.2 End-state operating contract

The incident is finished only when every healthy **existing linked** row above
is actually posting at its target cadence, not merely connected or enabled in
Postiz. API inventory proves Honne has TikTok EN/JA routes but no Instagram or
YouTube integration. Under the owner-directed API-only policy those missing
routes remain explicit `unavailable/missing_integration`, not blockers and not
borrowed Anicca accounts. If they are linked externally later, each begins with
one verified canary and ramps to the same three/day contract after
URL/Telegram/replay/metrics.
The owner-skipped Anicca `@anicca-jp` YouTube lane stays 0/day. Every other
connected integration is classified into this table or retained as an explicit
0/day hold; mixed-product accounts are never used to inflate coverage.

For every selected healthy destination, the durable owner must run continuously
and produce exactly three scheduled publication opportunities every local day.
For every scheduled post, the durable loop must produce the exact native URL
(or the approved exact Postiz/local-object proof for a TikTok photo carousel),
one natural publication receipt, 2h/24h/72h/7d plus daily/weekly metrics, and an
ASC/RevenueCat/product attribution status. Hook learning changes one hook only,
keeps format/CTA/account fixed, and proves the next generated post consumed the
keep/revert decision. This is the reusable open-source mobile-app marketing
loop required before a new app is onboarded. The marketing loop is not done
until this three/day publication, measurement, learning, and reporting cycle is
owned by Rockstar_ibot 24/7 for every selected destination with missed and
duplicate effects surfaced naturally instead of silently ignored.

Honne has no assigned Instagram account and no YouTube route. Do not create a
Honne Instagram/YouTube effect by borrowing an Anicca account. Native Larry
photo/carousel slideshows are also **not** in the armed portfolio yet. Life
Manager now has one imported, account-bound Larry JA pack that passed its
six-frame render audit plus a dedicated Postiz carousel publication contract.
It has not passed the real provider effect, direct-native-artifact, replay,
Telegram, or metric-source canary gates.

Every other live Postiz TikTok/Instagram/YouTube integration has a target
cadence of **0/day** until a later atomic classification binds it to a product,
locale, renderer, approved pack, campaign, and metric source. This explicit hold
includes:

- TikTok: `@aniccaaffirmation`, `@aniccaen2` (measured dead),
  `@monk_anicca` (provider-disabled), `@anicca.daily`, `@anicca_slideshow`,
  `@aniccajp`, `@anicca.jp8` (measured dead), `@aniccajp2`, `@anicca.jpx`
  (measured dead), `@obou_anicca`, `@anicca_buddha`, and `@anicca.comedy`.
- Instagram: `@anicca.affirmation`, `@obou.anicca`, and `@anicca.bochi`.
- YouTube: `@anicca-ai` and `@anicca-affirmation-video`.

An enabled Postiz connection in this hold list is routing configuration only.
It is not permission to publish. `@aniccaaffirmation` is a high-value research
candidate because the historical audit observed a 253,700-view video, but it
stays at 0/day until its separate English affirmation product/pack and app
attribution are proven; that evidence cannot be silently credited to the
Anicca iOS JA loop.

The three YouTube handles above are live Postiz profiles read back on 2026-08-21;
their current Postiz `disabled` value is `false`, but every Rockstar_ibot lane
is explicitly `disabled` until the direct-URL contract. They are not a
production assignment. YouTube is an **Anicca-only**
destination in this recovery. Honne has no YouTube job, account, campaign,
metric gate, or TODO; do not create or assign one. An Anicca YouTube lane stays
disabled until its live Postiz integration, product, locale, account, and direct
public URL are all recorded in the Rockstar_ibot manifest. A shared Anicca
YouTube channel cannot silently serve two product packs; if it is intentionally
shared, its campaign and reward joins must still remain product-scoped.

Postiz is retained for Honne TikTok/Instagram and Anicca
TikTok/Instagram/YouTube. The generic publication contract now accepts
`instagram`, `tiktok`, and Anicca-only `youtube`; YouTube uses its own Postiz
integration reference and accepts only a verified direct URL (`/shorts/<id>` or
`/watch?v=<id>`). YouTube remains disabled in the lane manifest until the
controlled provider canary; no Honne YouTube route is permitted.

**MKT-02 cursor (2026-08-21 JST — complete for the measured assignments).**
The Rockstar_ibot-side registry boundary is implemented as a secret-free
deterministic manifest normalizer and atomic writer. A read-only
`GET /public/v1/integrations` with the authorized credential returned `HTTP 200`
and 29 rows. The frozen artifact is
`~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/marketing/lane-manifest.json`, mode `0600`, with
manifest ID
`marketing-lane-manifest:9867179bbb8db1cbd434800562a92c40935b353789c2c60de4027dba9895790c`
and eight explicit routes: four target TikTok routes, two evidence-backed
Anicca Instagram routes, and two Anicca YouTube candidates held explicitly
disabled. All eight are `production_armed=false`; no provider write occurred.
The live registry contains no Honne Instagram profile, so Honne Instagram is
explicitly **unassigned**, not guessed or enabled. The artifact contains no
credential, OpenClaw path, or raw provider payload. The next gate is MKT-03's
single Honne EN TikTok canary; the Postiz credential remains outside Git and
must never be copied into the manifest.

**MKT-03 preflight (2026-08-21 JST — superseded by the controlled canary).**
The read-only preflight records two external blockers and one local lineage
precondition that is now satisfied:

1. `apps/rockstar_ibot/scripts/honne-en-canary.js` now has an explicit
   `LM_HONNE_EN_CANARY_TRANSPORT=postiz` path, but it requires the exact
   `PROMOTE_HONNE_EN_TIKTOK_CANARY` confirmation and performs a claim-before-
   effect preflight. Fake receipts remain test-only and cannot satisfy the
   real-publication acceptance gate.
2. A one-time, value-redacted migration now provisions only
   `LM_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `LM_TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID`, and
   `LM_POSTIZ_API_KEY` in `~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/.env` (mode `0600`).
   The source files remain untouched and are never passed to the Rockstar_ibot
   child process. Redacted Telegram `getMe` returned `ok=true` with bot
   username `AniccaLifeBot`; no token or chat value is recorded here.
3. The Rockstar_ibot-owned marketing data root now contains one tenant-scoped
   Honne EN candidate, still held in shadow: pack
   `object://sha256/adcdebe26b73d71911b0e89eab9dfb3e4e7155cc976841d339fbf1ac9df7aa3c`,
   verified 1080x1920/12-second H.264 media
   `object://sha256/cfbc17642a4df899e2c86169bdc5dc69ada3ab11181a1b0a8c67ba5a906b1aad`,
   copy object `object://sha256/ad83d11dc0b73aeecb842d7ea589c9572494ce82cd2339df3ea2f66c707448a8`,
   and a job-scoped approval object
   `object://sha256/8ce90da6656db6ed37ed774b17b4bb4a6be9712eb8f093f3065e18dd3abddc15`.
   The ready generation receipt is for `honne-ai`/`en`, creative
   `HEN-001-cfbc17642a4d`, slot `2026-08-22T02:00:00.000Z`; its TikTok
   publication job is queued at the explicit shadow-hold sentinel with the
   `@honne_reveal` integration. Replaying both inputs returned `created=false`
   and appended zero ledger rows. The approval object's basis is the existing
   standing-policy record; it is not evidence of an external publication.
   The Postiz credential alone does not create these lineage inputs. The real
   path still refuses a job unless its video, caption, and approval object refs
   resolve and its Instagram profile ref is the explicit
   `profile://instagram/unassigned` sentinel. Its Postiz executor is
   module-owned, its distribution child process receives only the explicit
   non-secret environment allowlist, and any publication receipt plus final
   redirect must remain on `@honne_reveal` with the same numeric video id.

The first canary attempt stopped before provider execution because the
distribution adapter did not recognise the existing
`approval_mode=standing_policy_no_additional_gate` object. The adapter now
accepts that explicit standing-policy shape (including a single JSON approval
object as well as JSONL) and the 37 existing distribution tests pass. The
failed attempt was reconciled as `absent` after a read-only Postiz target
search returned no row and no local publication ledger row; its JSONL backup is
retained outside Git.

**MKT-07 provider recheck (2026-08-21 JST).** The failed JP4 effect remains
terminal and is not retried. A fresh read-only Postiz detail fetch confirms the
provider-owned error is `postSocialPending` `START_TO_CLOSE` timeout with
`MAXIMUM_ATTEMPTS_REACHED`, and the row has neither `releaseId` nor
`releaseURL`. The same integration answers Postiz analytics successfully, so
the failure is publication-path/account state rather than a Rockstar_ibot
asset, caption, or lineage mismatch. Postiz has no public API endpoint that
completes a reconnect; its public OAuth route
(`GET /public/v1/social/tiktok?refresh=cmn8x8hdv028uqx0y4gdfse5t`) generated a
fresh TikTok authorization URL, but the existing browser session reached the
TikTok `/login` page. No password, MFA, provider write, or old OpenClaw job was
used. MKT-07 is therefore **blocked pending one owner-completed TikTok OAuth
reconnect for `@anicca.jp4`**, after which a new effect (never the failed one)
may be canaried and reconciled.

**MKT-03 controlled canary (2026-08-21 JST — quarantined historical attempt).**
One and only one Honne EN TikTok job was promoted from the shadow sentinel.
Postiz returned a reconciled `PUBLISHED` receipt for
`https://www.tiktok.com/@honne_reveal/video/7676366077437233172`, and a direct
HTTP readback returned `200` with the same account and numeric video ID. The
natural-language Telegram receipt used the same URL and returned
`message_id=27226`; its payload includes product, locale, platform, slot,
status, public URL, and retry state. The canary process replay returned
`publication_replay_created=false`, `telegram_created=false`, and
`telegram_replay_created=false`; a second process replay returned the same
message ID with all three duplicate flags false. However, the creative was a
generic Rockstar_ibot 12-second object rather than the migrated `honne-en`
ReelClaw pack. The row, receipt, and replay evidence remain preserved as
rollback evidence, but this attempt does not satisfy the approved-pack gate;
the next action is a new effect using the imported pack. No other lane was
enabled and no OpenClaw or legacy launchd job was touched.

**MKT-03 approved-pack retry (2026-08-21 JST — reconciled complete).** A
new generation was created from the migrated `honne-en` ReelClaw pack, not the
quarantined wake/demo object: creative `HEN-005-154a1508e0a8`, video object
`object://sha256/154a1508e0a869be1cd4f22dae729b8e7760940790cfc8d2e4a592b5bf67d36e`,
and caption object
`object://sha256/a8bfa3ab15744007138511e1738587b9e8bda3485a5f2c2feb49ba1909c31262`.
The job was promoted once through the Rockstar_ibot local ledger. Postiz then
created provider row `cmt2nc8gj00x5ph0yodvxq4dm` for integration
`cmoig11ew001zlv0yk6vqo1us` with state `PUBLISHED`, but exposed only the
profile URL `https://www.tiktok.com/@honne_reveal` and internal
`releaseId=v_pub_file~v2-1.7676386997019920404`. The public
profile/caption/time resolver initially could not produce a native URL, so the
local job correctly ended `unknown_effect=true` without retrying. A read-only
Chrome profile readback then matched the exact caption to
`https://www.tiktok.com/@honne_reveal/video/7676388327427149077`, which differs
from the Postiz suffix. The local ledger reconciled the same effect key as
`present`; the publication receipt carries `provider_reconciled=true`, and
Telegram sent one natural-language receipt with `message_id=27358`. The first
replay and a second process replay both created zero publication or Telegram
effects. The old generic canary remains quarantined evidence; no new provider
write was made during reconciliation.

The direct-URL resolver now keeps the yt-dlp path but falls back to the existing
CDP browser profile DOM when TikTok's JavaScript page defeats yt-dlp. It matches
the normalized caption against the newest profile links and still accepts only a
native `/video/<id>` URL. The fallback was read-only verified against the same
Honne EN caption and returned `7676388327427149077`; it never treats the Postiz
`releaseId` suffix as the provider ID.

**MKT-03A YouTube shadow contract (2026-08-21 JST — complete).** The generic
Rockstar_ibot publication adapter now accepts an Anicca-only YouTube platform
job with a platform-scoped `integration://postiz/youtube/...` reference. Receipt
verification accepts only direct `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/<id>` or
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>` URLs and rejects a channel/profile URL.
The shadow plan creates one YouTube job and invokes no provider transport; the
existing Instagram/TikTok job reference shape remains backward compatible.
Both live Postiz YouTube candidates remain explicitly `disabled` and no
provider write or scheduler change occurred. MKT-03B is the first provider
canary and remains open.

**MKT-03B asset/direct-URL correction (2026-08-21 JST).** The first Anicca
fan-out attempt used the Rockstar_ibot wake/demo object rather than the approved
Larry/ReelClaw mobile pack. The TikTok row is visible at
`https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp/video/7676379526930156821`; its thumbnail is
the same FaceTime wake render, so it is quarantined evidence and not an
accepted Anicca iOS canary. Postiz returned an internal release id ending in
`7676378097071163413`, which is **not** the native TikTok video id; the native
URL was found by public profile/caption/time readback. The adapter now refuses
to treat a numeric `releaseId` as a verified public URL and must resolve the
provider profile before recording a direct TikTok receipt. The remaining MKT-03B
canary must use the migrated approved pack and a native direct URL; no retry of
the quarantined creative is allowed.

**Wrong-content root cause and permanent guard.** The Anicca canary's Postiz
account and API route were correct; Rockstar_ibot supplied the wrong bytes. The
generic canary accepted `format_id=anicca-wake` because the earlier generation
and publication contracts checked hashes and provider references but did not
enforce the product's approved format family. That let the Rockstar_ibot
`lm_wake_JA` demo pass the provider boundary. The guard is now fail-closed in
both adapters: Anicca accepts only Larry/ReelClaw families, Honne accepts only
the migrated Honne ReelClaw family, and unknown formats are rejected before any
Postiz call. Runtime inputs are LM object refs only; every future lane must
pass the same one-lane canary, native URL, Telegram, replay, and seven-cycle
gates. The original wrong Anicca row remains quarantine evidence and is never
reused.

**Telegram binding discovery (2026-08-21 JST — transport and LM ownership
complete for I-3).** The canonical job-search loop remains the existing working reference for
the natural-language/report transport: `apps/job-search-loop/job_search_loop/telegram.py`
calls the Telegram Bot API directly, keeps an at-most-once SQLite outbox, and
reads only the private job-search configuration at
`~/.config/anicca/job-search/telegram.env` (mode `0600`, keys
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `JOB_SEARCH_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`). Its durable evidence
contains successful receipts with message IDs `4421` and `26925`; replay reads
the same outbox and does not resend. This proves that the other loop's transport
is healthy, not that its bot/chat credential belongs to Rockstar_ibot.

No transport copy is needed: Rockstar_ibot already owns the equivalent direct
Bot API helper at `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/telegram.js` and the durable
`marketing-liveness-adapter.js` path that renders the required natural-language
receipt and validates the provider message ID. Copying job-search code would
create a second sender, not remove the binding blocker.

The shared shell helper `skills/_shared/send-telegram.sh` remains out of the
runtime because its fallback reads `$HOME/.openclaw/.env`. Rockstar_ibot imports
no OpenClaw folder/env/assets at runtime and does not read the job-search env
after the one-time migration. The LM-owned env contains only the three required
secret names, is mode `0600`, and is excluded from Git, ledgers, logs, and this
spec. The canary above proves the direct Bot API transport, receipt binding,
and replay dedupe without exposing any credential value.

### 8.9 Telegram marketing reporting contract

The ledger is machine-readable; Telegram is always a natural-language
projection of that ledger. Raw JSON, `label exit=N`, raw log tails, and a bare
profile URL are not reports. Every message names the product, locale, platform,
account, expected slot, observation window, status, retry state, and source
health. The three tiers are:

| Tier | Cadence | Required content |
|---|---|---|
| Publication/incident receipt | immediately after reconciliation or a missed slot | product + locale + platform + account + slot; `published`/`missed`; direct public URL or `unavailable`; provider post ID; retry state; campaign ID |
| App/account digest | daily | every production-armed lane, expected/published/missed/duplicate counts, social metrics, attributed installs, activation, trials, paid users, proceeds/MRR, and unavailable sources |
| Portfolio review | weekly | Honne and Anicca separately; platform/account winners and failures, attribution coverage, retention/revenue movement, source failures, one keep/revert decision, and the next bounded change |

The natural-language message is generated from a deterministic snapshot hash so
the panel and Telegram can be reconciled. `unavailable`, `partial`, and
`conflict` are written as words with their source/error; they are never printed
as zero. A rerun with the same snapshot and effect key sends no duplicate
message. A production message must identify itself as `Rockstar_ibot:::` and
must not expose secrets or OpenClaw paths.

**2026-08-21 legacy-report observation.** The owner-visible line beginning
`📤 user6721125412040 · tiktok` with the caption fragment and
`https://www.tiktok.com/@honne_reveal` is not a Rockstar_ibot receipt. It is
the legacy `marketing-engine/report/notify_posts.py` projection: it uses the
Postiz integration name as the account label and forwards the provider's
profile-only `releaseURL`, so it is neither natural language nor a verified
publication link. The corresponding
`ai.anicca.marketing-post-notify` LaunchAgent was loaded but inactive with
`StartInterval=1800`; its prior log contains raw-notifier sends. On
2026-08-21 JST it was explicitly disabled through
`bin/launchctl-safe disable gui/501/ai.anicca.marketing-post-notify` after the
control-plane preflight passed. No kickstart, stop, restart, bootout, or
deletion was performed; the plist and logs remain rollback evidence. Life
Manager's shared Telegram renderer produces a sentence with
product/locale/platform/account/slot, explicit status, `Public URL`, and
`Retry`, and its regression test rejects that raw legacy shape. The full
MKT-11A daily/weekly snapshot projection remains open; this closes only the
per-post renderer boundary and quarantines the raw legacy sender.

### 8.10 Social metrics, app metrics, and attribution

Every observation row has the immutable join keys
`product_id`, `locale`, `platform`, `account_id`, `integration_id`,
`provider_post_id`, `public_url`, `campaign_id`, `creative_id`, `slot`,
`observed_at`, and `window`. The metric value also carries `source`, `status`,
and `error`.

| Surface | Metrics collected when the provider exposes them |
|---|---|
| TikTok | delivery, views, hold/completion, likes, comments, saves/shares, profile/link clicks |
| Instagram | delivery, reach/plays, likes, comments, saves/shares, profile/link clicks |
| YouTube | delivery, views, watch time/average duration, likes, comments, subscribers, link clicks |
| App | store clicks, installs, activation, trial start, paid receipt, renewal, proceeds, monthly-equivalent MRR |

The attribution chain is:

`publication URL → platform/account → campaign link → store click → install → activation → trial → paid receipt → renewal`.

The campaign link layer uses the existing Apple `pt`/`ct` contract or an
equivalent first-party smart-link contract. A TikTok spike is not treated as
causal merely because installs rose on the same day. Reports show verified
attributed installs, partial/unattributed installs, attribution coverage, and
the observation window separately. RevenueCat/App Store Connect/product
analytics are the financial and app truth; Postiz is the social publication and
post-metric source. Missing provider data remains `null`/unavailable.

### 8.11 OSS reference research (learn first, copy only after license review)

The following repositories are reference material, not new runtime dependencies:

| Repository | Useful pattern | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| [`gitroomhq/postiz-app`](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app) (AGPL-3.0) | scheduler, provider adapters, analytics, self-hosted/hosted parity | keep using Postiz API; do not vendor-copy into Rockstar_ibot without AGPL review |
| [`gitroomhq/postiz-agent`](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-agent) (AGPL-3.0) | integration discovery, YouTube/TikTok/Instagram settings, post and analytics commands | copy the discovery/checklist ideas only; Rockstar_ibot keeps its own local ledger |
| [`grovs-io/grovs-iOS`](https://github.com/grovs-io/grovs-iOS) (MIT) | iOS smart links, deferred deep links, StoreKit 2 revenue attribution | evaluate for the campaign-link join; do not add before the incident canary |
| [`zmsp/AppRankly`](https://github.com/zmsp/AppRankly) (AGPL-3.0) | App Store/Play installs, retention, ASO and report vocabulary | study metric definitions only; its Docker/database deployment is not the local recovery runtime |
| [`nowork-studio/NotFair`](https://github.com/nowork-studio/NotFair) (MIT) | measured baseline, one action per observation window, rollback and local receipts | reuse the bounded-learning pattern, not its agent runtime |
| [`loopmark-opensource/loopmark-agent`](https://github.com/loopmark-opensource/loopmark-agent) (MIT) | content/funnel decomposition | reference only; it does not provide reliable social-follower analytics |

OSS adoption must preserve Rockstar_ibot's local-first boundary, product/locale
isolation, truthful unavailable states, and the no-mass-reenable incident gate.

**Ordered remainder for this engine** (mirrors the harness task list):

| # | Work | Gate | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hook-variation gate + background pool | a hook repeated inside the exclusion window cannot render | **done** — the gate skipped the pinned hook on a real run and picked the next pooled one; background rotation is tested but enabled per variant via `bg_pool` |
| 2 | Per-account attribution (Apple `pt`/`ct` campaign links) | one publication URL joined to installs and then to a paid event | **link layer done** — three accounts hold store-verified links (http=200), a bogus app id is refused; the install/paid join is unproven until posts run |
| 3 | Repair the ebook checkout | one real purchase reaches the ledger | the 401 was the **expired test key**; the live key answers 200. Product, $19 price, payment link and a post-purchase PDF redirect now exist — the remaining gap is traffic, not plumbing |
| 4 | Three-tier Telegram reporting | every publication/miss, daily app/account digest, and weekly portfolio review is natural language and names every ERROR-state post | open — replace `label exit=N` and raw log tails with the §8.9 snapshot projection |
| 5 | Put each account's campaign link in its bio | link visible on IG/TikTok/YouTube profiles | open |
| 6 | Reward scoring at 2h/24h/72h/7–35d, then kill/scale rules | a daily record of what was killed and what was scaled | **partly done** — engagement-depth scoring runs daily and refuses tiny cohorts; install/paid depth waits on Apple's report data |
| 7 | Apply the same variation gate + fresh hook pool to ReelClaw video | `hookPool-ja.txt` (static since 2026-03-17) is replaced by mined hooks under the gate | open |
| 8 | Point `clip` at `load_manifest.sh` + `poster.py` | one posting path for every loop | open |
| 9 | Product packs for aniccaios / honne / ebook EN / ebook JA | a new product runs with a manifest and zero engine edits | open |
| 10 | Scale accounts 1 → 5 → 50 at 2–3 posts/day | 10–20 posts/day per product, warmup respected | blocked on 4 and 6 — volume before measurement reproduces the 10M-views/5-signups failure |
| 11 | Keep Postiz as the primary provider while evaluating optional local replacement | selected Instagram/TikTok/YouTube lanes publish with verified provider URLs and metrics | **deferred** — no Postiz exit is part of incident recovery; any later replacement needs a new parity/cutover gate |

## 9. `$10k MRR` operating model

No verified product-level subscription baseline is imported into Rockstar_ibot.
The plan therefore treats the figures below as target mechanics, never as a
claim about Anicca or Honne revenue.

Twelve-month scenarios:

| Scenario | Blended MRR / active subscriber | Install→paid | Monthly churn | Active subscribers needed | New paid/month needed | Installs/month needed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Best | $8.00 | 5.0% | 5% | 1,250 | 136 | 2,714 |
| Base | $6.00 | 3.0% | 8% | 1,667 | 211 | 7,021 |
| Worst | $4.17 | 1.5% | 12% | 2,399 | 367 | 24,449 |

These are target mechanics, not forecasts. The first growth gate is not
“post more”; it is:

1. Restore trustworthy per-product install and revenue collection.
2. Establish one complete attribution chain from publication to paid.
3. Raise the number of genuinely distinct tested hooks per week.
4. Improve the weakest measured funnel step.
5. Scale publishing only after a challenger beats its product-specific
   baseline without retention or revenue regression.

Honne and Anicca are reported as separate products first:

`MRR_product = active paid monthly-equivalent receipts × net monthly ARPU`.

The portfolio total is the sum of verified product receipts. A target of
`$10k` combined is different from `$10k` for Honne plus `$10k` for Anicca; the
latter is a `$20k` portfolio target. Social views and likes are acquisition
signals, not MRR, and a TikTok/Instagram/YouTube spike is not credited to a
product until the campaign-to-install-to-paid join is verified.

### 10.2 Today

The first screen answers three questions:

1. Am I financially healthier than yesterday?
2. What made or lost money?
3. What did Rockstar_ibot do, and what needs attention?

Top cards:

| Card | Content |
|---|---|
| Net worth | current value, day/month delta, freshness |
| Income | today and month-to-date |
| Operating profit | revenue minus attributable costs |
| Recurring revenue | total MRR and target progress |
| Attention | failed connector, anomaly, blocked job, required authorization |

Below the cards: business contribution, mobile growth funnel, recent autonomous
actions, and source-health strip.

### 10.3 Financial Health

Four tabs:

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| Overview | net worth, liquid cash, runway, income, expenses, profit |
| Businesses | P&L and MRR by product/business |
| Assets | bank, NISA, crypto, yield positions, liabilities |
| Ledger | reconciled transactions, classifications, provenance, freshness |

All numbers show source and last sync. Unknown values display “Unavailable”,
never `0`.

### 10.4 Mobile Apps

Portfolio row per app:

`installs → activation → paywall → trial → paid → retained → MRR`

App detail includes acquisition by channel/creative, store conversion,
subscription cohorts, experiment history, content calendar, and the current
bottleneck. Anicca and Honne never share learned weights.

### 10.5 Marketing Studio

| Area | User sees |
|---|---|
| Content | published artifact thumbnail/title plus the raw TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube URL |
| Queue | planned, rendering, scheduled, published, observing |
| Format library | source, format DNA, product fit, recent usage, performance |
| Learning audit | changed rule, blame evidence, canary, keep/revert, consumption proof; read-only and autonomous |
| Accounts | platform health, last successful post, rate/quality limits |

There are no user-facing experiment buttons and no public artifact page. The UI
exposes receipts, not agent narration. A green state requires a real platform
URL or verified metric row.

### 10.6 Connections and deployment

Users connect App Store Connect with an API key, social platforms with
OAuth/session adapters, and banking through Moneytree LINK. Raw passwords are
not a product interface.

| Mode | User experience | Availability |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud, recommended | sign in from phone/web, authorize connectors, Rockstar_ibot remains online without a personal computer | managed multi-tenant services and autoscaled workers |
| Local/self-hosted | install Rockstar_ibot, run one command, use localhost/PWA and optional Telegram | runs only while that machine is online |
| Local→Cloud migration | export an encrypted tenant bundle, import it to cloud, reconcile cursors and receipts, then switch scheduler ownership | no loop runs from both schedulers during cutover |

The panel shows the active deployment, scheduler owner, last successful cycle,
and whether turning off the current machine would stop work. Mac Codex commands
use `rockstar_ibot` CLI or the authenticated API in either mode.

## 11. Failure handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Source delayed | retain last good value, mark stale, exclude from fresh delta |
| Duplicate webhook | inbox idempotency key returns existing receipt |
| Local worker or cloud worker dies | lease expires; bounded retry on an eligible worker in the same deployment |
| Publish result unknown | reconcile platform before retry; never blind repost |
| Metrics unavailable | observation becomes insufficient; no learning change |
| Canary regression | restore prior weight hash and record revert |
| Cross-tenant/product evidence | reject and dead-letter |
| OpenClaw stopped during shadow | new path continues; any dependency failure blocks cutover |
| Local→cloud transfer interrupted | scheduler ownership remains with the source until import reconciliation succeeds |
| Internet/power loss in local mode | show offline/stale state; resume idempotently when available; do not claim always-on execution |
| Mac unavailable in cloud mode | no effect; API, workers, schedules, and reports continue in cloud |

## 12. Ordered delivery plan

The order below is the program source of truth. The local incident outcome is a
hard gate: no hosted/cloud work begins until every retained loop is
demonstrably OpenClaw-independent and running under the direct Rockstar_ibot
local process. Hosted work is deferred and is not required to restore mobile
marketing.

Order 0 consolidation completed:
`AE-X402-SOURCE-CONSOLIDATE-1`. `OSS-SECURITY-BASELINE-1` merged in PR
#1274 with all exact-five security checks green. `REPO-V0-RETIRE-1` then
completed 35/35 disposition, issue transfer, redirect, archive, and
runtime-reference-zero. Evidence:
`docs/evidence/security/2026-07-29-oss-security-baseline.md` and
`docs/evidence/repository/2026-07-29-rockstar_ibot-v0-retirement.md`.
The x402 nine-route seller is present in canonical
`services/x402-endpoint`; historical and canonical suites pass 68/68, the
migration contract passes 1/1, ledger regression passes 22/22, and dependency
audit is zero. PR #1295 merged as `4d5c60b9…`; Railway source/root/commit,
deployment `cee9598d…` SUCCESS, nine paid gates, settlement target exactly1,
ledger real-loop duplicate1, exact-five, and 251/251 cutover health are read back.
`OSS-MERGE-1` PR #1268 is merged as canonical `8d47689d3…`; that exact `main`
commit passes a clean fresh clone, 647/647 app tests, all eight evals, panel
privacy, the seven-source manifest, and the single canonical runner contract.
The current incident subcursor is MKT-03B: run the first correct Anicca
Larry/ReelClaw canary. The owner explicitly removes the redundant calendar and
seven-cycle bureaucracy; product-format, native-URL, natural-Telegram, and
effect-dedupe guards remain active.

| Order | Deliverable | Exit evidence |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | Finish single-repository consolidation | **done** — PR #1268 merged as `8d47689d3…`; exact-main fresh clone, source manifest, single runner, security boundary, v0 archive, and x402 source cutover are verified. Browser/parity/cloud/remaining-legacy gates continue under their own ordered rows |
| 1 | Freeze all scheduler/runtime inventory | machine-readable inventory covers every captured OpenClaw store row and user LaunchAgent, including disabled, unloaded, and parse-error rows, with redacted command, cadence, source boundary, load state, and latest available receipt |
| 2 | Decide every legacy job | each row is marked `migrate`, `replace`, `retire`, or `retain-external` (vocabulary amendment, decided: third-party/system rows whose command references no openclaw/legacy path stay outside migration scope with owner `system`) with Rockstar_ibot owner and rollback action; no unowned enabled/loaded job |
| 3 | Define portable domain contracts | tenant/product/business/loop/job/artifact/publication/source-event/receipt schemas and adapter interfaces pass contract tests |
| 4 | Create Rockstar_ibot local deployment | one direct local entrypoint starts the Rockstar_ibot scheduler/worker processes and creates the Rockstar_ibot data root without OpenClaw, Docker, Colima, Railway, or a database |
| 5 | Establish Rockstar_ibot-owned paths | code, prompts, media templates, state, logs, and config live in the monorepo or configured Rockstar_ibot data root; dependency scan rejects legacy absolute paths |
| 6 | Move secrets out of OpenClaw | every retained connector reads OS keychain/encrypted Rockstar_ibot vault references; `~/.openclaw/.env` is inaccessible in tests |
| 7 | Implement durable local scheduler and job protocol | append-only JSONL enqueue/receipt ledgers, atomic claim/lease files, retry, dead-letter, idempotency, effect reconciliation, and restart recovery pass local tests |
| 8 | Extract reusable Profitable Claude contracts | registry, schemas, learner, canary, terminalizer, and dashboard logic run from Rockstar_ibot packages |
| 9 | Migrate Telegram command/report delivery | Rockstar_ibot owns bot routing, tenant mapping, digest schedules, raw public URLs, receipts, and anti-spam policy; no experiment buttons or public artifact page |
| 10 | Migrate existing financial-report loop | current x402/TaskMarket/USDC daily and weekly outputs run locally from Rockstar_ibot with matching snapshot hashes |
| 11 | Migrate Larry/ReelClaw Anicca and Honne | all retained slideshow/video generation, rendering, posting, schedules, assets, and sessions run through Rockstar_ibot jobs |
| 12 | Migrate Capafy, clipping, writer, gig, bounty, and other income loops | every retained income job produces a Rockstar_ibot receipt and no legacy-path read |
| 13 | Migrate retained personal, school, comedy, SEO, mail, memory, and maintenance jobs | all remaining retained enabled/loaded workflows are Rockstar_ibot loops or explicitly retired |
| 14 | Switch local scheduler ownership | launchd, if retained only as a boot trigger, starts Rockstar_ibot; no launchd command invokes OpenClaw or legacy repositories |
| 15 | Prove Milestone A: OpenClaw-free local | stop gateway, deny/rename `~/.openclaw`, run seven expected cycles, reconcile real effects, scan zero runtime references, preserve signed rollback inventory |
| 16 | Archive non-v0 legacy runtime sources | create signed read-only archives and retention policy for OpenClaw, Profitable Claude, and retired checkouts; no production fallback to archived code (`life-manager-v0` already closes at Order 0) |
| 17 | Package supported local/self-hosted mode | versioned direct-process installer, upgrade, backup/restore, health check, and local documentation pass on a clean machine; Docker/Colima are not required |
| 18 | Implement hosted deployment adapters (deferred) | optional database/object/tenant-vault/worker adapters pass the same contracts without changing the required local path |
| 19 | Deploy hosted control plane and worker pools (deferred) | a future provider-neutral API/panel/scheduler plus worker pools operate from the same release version; Railway is not an incident dependency |
| 20 | Add multi-tenant isolation, fairness, and autoscaling | row/secret/profile isolation, quotas, rate limits, weighted scheduling, queue-depth scaling, and noisy-neighbor tests pass |
| 21 | Implement local→cloud tenant migration | encrypted export/import preserves IDs, cursors, artifacts, receipts, settings, and secrets; exactly one scheduler owns each loop |
| 22 | Shadow cloud against local | cloud replays read-only/duplicate-safe work and matches local artifacts, reports, and decision hashes |
| 23 | Canary and cut over Dais to cloud | real retained posts and reports run in cloud; local scheduler is stopped after reconciled parity |
| 24 | Prove cloud-default availability | Mac Mini powered off through seven expected cycles; retained loops, reports, and alerts continue without duplicates |
| 25 | Ship monthly cloud subscription | phone/web signup, Stripe monthly entitlement, cloud connector authorization, quotas, source health, export/delete, cancellation, and self-host option |
| 26 | Prove 1,000-tenant scale and recovery | synthetic workload demonstrates fair scheduling, credential isolation, idempotent effects, worker loss recovery, and bounded queue age |
| 27 | Add financial connector framework | cursors, freshness, original currency, FX provenance, transfer handling, and explicit unavailable states |
| 28 | Add Moneytree and App Store Connect | bank balance plus per-product installs, proceeds, and connector health; subscription metrics arrive only through a product-pack input owned outside Rockstar_ibot |
| 29 | Add Stripe and read-only crypto/investment assets | net worth and business P&L reconcile across supported sources |
| 30 | Ship Financial Health UI and Telegram | panel and Telegram render the same snapshot hash with daily, weekly, monthly, and exception receipts |
| 31 | Create Anicca and Honne product packs | independent JA/EN offers, attribution, rewards, weights, accounts, and forbidden claims |
| 32 | Complete publication lineage | every Larry/ReelClaw artifact joins product, campaign, experiment, publication URL, and real effect receipt |
| 33 | Add metric collectors and app attribution | 2h/24h/72h/7d platform metrics join installs, trials, paid users, proceeds, and retention without converting unavailable to zero |
| 34 | Build viral-format intake and variation gates | source/right receipts, format DNA, duplicate hooks, semantic similarity, format concentration, proof, locale, and visual/transcript gates |
| 35 | Activate bounded self-improvement | one-rule blame, challenger, canary, keep/revert, and next-run consumption proof work for Anicca and Honne separately |
| 36 | Add Physical and Mental Health | separate daily messages, dashboard sections, source freshness, risk policy, and one-action interventions |
| 37 | Design and build mobile-app development loop | metrics and feedback drive bounded app iteration before generalized creation/release |
| 38 | Generalize web-app development loop | reuse portable runtime, product, finance, marketing, experiment, and deployment contracts |

### 12.1 Remaining work from the measured state

The numbered program above remains the SSOT. Until Order 26 passes, only
runtime-migration work is active:

The 2026-08-20 mobile-marketing outage is the active preservation slice inside
Orders 9 and 11. Its order is fixed so that recovery does not recreate competing
schedulers or revive known-broken producers:

| Incident order | Work | Done evidence | State |
|---:|---|---|---|
| I-0 | Freeze incident truth and preserve rollback | live OpenClaw SQLite, launchd disabled overrides, Postiz connectivity/integrations, last public URLs, logs, and quarantine backup are read back without changing state | **done** |
| I-1 | Add expected-slot liveness and Telegram incident reporting in Rockstar_ibot | independent liveness service + durable message jobs; fake Telegram proves direct reconciled artifact URL, truthful unavailable miss, replay dedupe, and zero jobs for disabled/default-off/shadow; changed runtime scope scans 0 legacy dependencies | **implementation done; repository-wide scan passes with zero violations** |
| I-2 | Wire the generic Rockstar_ibot video chain to a default-off Honne EN schedule | exact 07:00/11:00/20:30 Asia/Tokyo slots generate durable jobs with no OpenClaw path or env read; shadow performs zero provider writes | **done** — `LM_HONNE_EN_SHADOW_ENABLED=false`; generation and publication lineage preserve Honne EN product/locale/creative/account refs; publication jobs are durable but claim-ineligible at the explicit-promotion sentinel, replay creates zero duplicates, and the EN status grid reports passed slots without receipts as missed. Runtime adapters and runtime-up suites pass; changed runtime scope has zero legacy references. The repository-wide scan passes with zero violations. |
| I-3 | Run one controlled Honne EN canary from Rockstar_ibot using the migrated approved pack | one real TikTok publication reconciles as `PUBLISHED`, its direct `/video/<id>` URL returns publicly, Telegram receives the same URL, replay produces no duplicate | **done** — approved-pack creative `HEN-005-154a1508e0a8` reconciled the existing Postiz row `cmt2nc8gj00x5ph0yodvxq4dm` to `https://www.tiktok.com/@honne_reveal/video/7676388327427149077`; direct readback returned HTTP 200, Telegram receipt `message_id=27358` carried the same URL, and initial/second replay created zero new effects. The earlier generic row at `7676366077437233172` remains quarantined rollback evidence. No OpenClaw or legacy launchd job was changed. |
| I-4 | Prove seven consecutive Honne EN cycles | every explicit run has one verified generation, publication, URL, notification, and replay receipt | **removed by owner instruction** — one correct on-demand HEN-006 receipt remains evidence; the extra seven-cycle gate and calendar wait add no value to the immediate recovery and are deleted. The format, URL, Telegram, and idempotency guards remain |
| I-5 | Repair and migrate Anicca video/slideshow producers one lane at a time | missing hook sources, blank IDs, poster arguments, and secret boundaries are fixed behind Rockstar_ibot contracts; each lane passes one canary with direct receipt and metrics | open |
| I-6 | Migrate Honne JA, then remaining Larry/ReelClaw routes | each retained route preserves product/locale/account behavior and no longer reads OpenClaw or another repository at runtime | **partly done —** Honne JA `@honnevideo` now has one LM-owned ReelClaw canary with direct URL, Telegram, and replay evidence; remaining routes stay open |
| I-7 | Close observation and bounded learning | 2h/24h/72h/7d/35d metrics join artifact→publication→account→campaign→install→trial→paid→proceeds; unavailable is not zero; one variable changes per challenger and keep/revert is consumed by the next run | open |
| I-8 | Retire legacy marketing ownership | only after every retained lane passes its canary, direct receipt, metrics, and replay; OpenClaw/legacy launch state remains disabled as rollback history and Rockstar_ibot is the sole owner | open |

### 12.2 Near-term mobile-marketing return TODO

This is the remaining operational list for returning the existing mobile
marketing fleet. It does not create a second scheduler and it does not enable
the quarantined OpenClaw fleet. Only the first unchecked item is active.
The historical rows below remain evidence, but the complete current execution
order is the §12.3 recovery checklist: `MKT-09R0 → MKT-09R1 → MKT-09R2 →
MKT-09R3-01..13 → MKT-09R4..R9 → MKT-10 → MKT-11 → MKT-12 → MKT-13`.
No later row starts early.

Current TODO state: **incident recovery remains open at MKT-11 cadence Order 8,
one destination at a time.** MKT-09R0 through the selected Postiz canary
portfolio are terminal: capacity is safe, the shared publication fence remains closed,
the JP4 false completion is quarantined, and the 13-effect set is 12 `present`
plus one truthful `absent`. The full publication ledger is 43 `completed`,
one `conflict`, and zero unknown/running/reconciling jobs. This does not prove
all accounts or schedules healthy: the measured live schedules still produced
only 32 of 64 expected provider rows, most accounts remain unclassified at
0/day, and two delayed effects missed their logical slots by hours.
MKT-12A0 remains blocked until cadence and attribution are healthy. Honne still has TikTok
destinations only; dedicated Honne Instagram and YouTube integrations do not
yet exist.

For every selected Postiz video/Reel/carousel lane, publication success now
requires the exact Postiz API row in `PUBLISHED` state plus the exact LM
product/account/integration/platform/creative/local-media/caption lineage. A
profile URL or numeric release suffix without that exact row and lineage is not
success. A caption-matching native URL and browser/login readback are optional
diagnostics, not publication gates. No Google login is part of this recovery.

An external observation clock is not an active implementation item. It remains
`time-gated pending` only when it has an exact due time, a durable LM owner, and
terminal acceptance evidence. Exactly one executable atomic item remains active;
when the clock fires, its readback is reconciled before any dependent account arm.

**Active executable atomic item:** MKT-09R9-15 / Order 24F10 reconciles the
existing `@anicca_slideshow` API canary; it creates no new publication. For this
TikTok **native photo carousel** lane only, publication acceptance is the exact
Postiz API/DB row in `PUBLISHED` state with matching integration, caption, title,
slot, and DIRECT_POST settings plus the LM-local SHA-verified pack, six ordered
JPEGs, caption, approval, and media-order hash. A direct native photo URL is not
required because Postiz does not expose one for this photo form. This exception
does not weaken video/Reel lanes: those still require their direct native URL.
After durable reconciliation, send one natural Telegram receipt describing the
account/content/Postiz state without inventing a URL, prove same-effect replay 0,
record immediate source status, and register 2h/24h/72h/7d under the durable LM
owner. No other account or cadence begins.

The first 24F10 slot `2026-08-26T04:46:42.000Z` is terminal `absent`, not a
publication success and not retryable as the same job. Exact job
`marketing-native-carousel-publication:87916760…038c6e2` failed attempt 1 in
local pre-provider validation with `carousel images are Instagram-only`; the
exact Postiz integration window contains zero rows, Telegram contains no success
receipt, controls returned to armed 0/fence closed, and durable reconciliation
sets `unknown_effect=false`, `decision=absent`. The shared transport's second
Instagram-only branch is corrected to accept only Instagram/TikTok photo
carousels, preserve the caller's exact platform/title, poll the exact platform,
and require a direct TikTok URL before success. Python regression is 21/21.
After this fix is pushed, 24F10 permits one new-slot attempt only; it does not
reuse or reinterpret the absent effect.

The initial new-slot command then failed locally at enqueue with `local ledger
job id collision`; provider and Telegram effects remain 0. This is the intended
dedupe response because job/effect identity excludes slot. The approved recovery
is a new immutable creative revision
`EN-SLIDESHOW-PROCRASTINATION-05090bf2b4ee-R2` over the same inspected
pack/media/caption, with approval
`object://sha256/6e69c242e75481d2d6a3f51fe2c07e5dc151bb33c9b29f30972e81aa5bf8f668`.
The old absent effect and approval remain retained evidence; no ledger dedupe
rule is weakened and no media/caption changes are smuggled into the retry.

The R2 provider effect exists and is accepted under the photo-carousel rule;
it must not be retried. Postiz row `cmt9mebpj0341mp0ymi31r582` is `PUBLISHED` with the
exact caption/title/integration and numeric release suffix
`7678198747632977937`, while its release URL is still only the profile URL.
The numeric suffix remains provider metadata and is not converted into a URL.
Local job `marketing-native-carousel-publication:0cd8be1c…c788f` is now
terminal `completed`, `reconciliation_decision=present`, and
`unknown_effect=false`. Its verified receipt binds Postiz row
`cmt9mebpj0341mp0ymi31r582`, provider state `PUBLISHED`, integration
`cmnenjkff01j1pa0ysufmzhfr`, exact caption/title/DIRECT_POST metadata, pack
`3241653e…de624c`, six ordered media hashes, order hash `97cb56b3…1c3855`, and
caption hash `8e6f7cec…f2c6d`; `public_url=null` is explicit and no URL is invented.
Telegram/replay/metrics are the next atomic steps.
The shared natural-language renderer now accepts this exact photo proof as
`postiz_published_exact_assets`, says Postiz API `PUBLISHED` and exact approved
local assets/caption matched, and omits a nonexistent public URL. Video/Reel
messages retain their direct-URL validation. Focused liveness/runner tests are
21/21; the next action is replaying the existing slot to create exactly one
Telegram message, followed by a second replay proving message 0/publication 0.

That Telegram/replay gate is now terminal. The LM runner replayed the existing
slot with publication `created=false`, sent one natural receipt as provider
message `34998`, then replayed again with publication `created=false` and
Telegram `created=false` returning the same message ID. The retained publication
receipt count for Postiz row `cmt9mebpj0341mp0ymi31r582` remains exactly one.
The only active atomic item is immediate Postiz metric-source status plus durable
2h/24h/72h/7d ownership for this photo receipt; no new publication starts.

Metrics code now discovers this exact reconciled photo receipt by job/account/
integration/format/form/locale/caption-object identity and routes it through
Postiz API only. It persists post fields from post analytics, current account
plus latest-20 aggregates from account analytics, and marks every empty or
unsupported field `unavailable` rather than zero. URL-free photo snapshots and
their natural Telegram wording use the same
`postiz_published_exact_assets` evidence. Existing direct-video metrics remain
unchanged. Focused metrics/liveness tests pass 18/18. Next: push, trigger the
existing LM metrics owner, and read back pending/due status plus any immediate
provider source observation.

**Remaining atomic TODO SSOT — execute strictly in this order:**

1. **Done:** `@anicca_slideshow` metrics: add the exact receipt to the LM Postiz-API
   metrics owner; persist immediate source status and automatic 2h/24h/72h/7d
   windows; report measured account/post fields naturally to Telegram; preserve
   empty/missing fields as `unavailable`, never zero.
2. **Done:** close `@anicca_slideshow` as `canary-verified/default-off`, armed 0, with
   publication present, Telegram `34998`, replay publication 0/message 0, and
   metric-owner evidence.
3. **Done for the selected portfolio:** classify each exact Postiz integration by
   product, locale, account, platform, renderer, content form, and approved asset
   family. Mixed/wrong/unknown routes become hold at 0/day.
4. **Done for the selected portfolio:** import and visually approve one correct
   local pack per account. Bind object hashes, caption, media order, account,
   integration, renderer, and form.
5. **Done for the selected portfolio:** run one API canary for each account only.
   Confirm Postiz `PUBLISHED` and exact
   stored assets/caption; send one natural Telegram receipt; prove publication
   replay 0/message replay 0; register immediate plus 2h/24h/72h/7d metrics.
6. **Done for the selected portfolio:** repeat steps 3–5 one account at a time for
   every retained TikTok and Instagram integration. Do not create missing Honne
   Instagram/YouTube routes and do not relabel Anicca accounts as Honne.
7. **Done-skipped:** the login-dependent Anicca YouTube route remains skipped at
   0/day because no usable API-only route exists.
8. **Active:** enable cadence only for individually healthy verified accounts,
   first one live slot, then the second, then the third after each preceding slot proves
   published/missed/duplicate and metric-source health. The terminal cadence is
   exactly 3/day on every selected available destination. Never mass-enable.
   **Honne EN first live slot done:** the shared ledger now permits an exact
   production-armed lane through the closed canary fence while open fences still
   require their exact effect. LM owner published HEN-016 as Postiz row
   `cmt9peveo00btlf0yb63uguqg`, natural Telegram `35067`, and replay kept
   jobs/receipts at `841/272` with publication 0/message 0 and exit 0. Manifest
   `af258cc29fffd0446bae20967de9388ce13d5e388c9d0ff180dce7d7122486fe`
   arms Honne EN only at target 3/day; every other selected lane remains armed 0.
   **Honne JA first live slot done:** exact creative `HJA-022-ced745f2245a`
   published as Postiz row `cmt9pt0tt00f3lf0y046lm2lo`; the LM receipt binds
   the JA ReelClaw account/integration, video hash `ced745f2…a9472`, caption hash
   `9e407699…7510dd6`, and natural Telegram `35080`. Replay kept jobs
   `847→847`, receipts `274→274`, publication/message `created=false`, and owner
   exit 0. Manifest `65f910db5d5124b6d50bb5864edc63cb82b34c45388180eb1765d66ff7624245`
   arms exactly Honne EN and Honne JA at 3/day. Transport commit `574d0662e`
   derives a TikTok candidate only from an exact `PUBLISHED` Postiz row with an
   accepted TikTok release-id shape; focused Postiz tests pass 21/21.
   **Anicca main TikTok first live slot done:** LM label
   `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-anicca-main-tiktok` now runs from the fixed stable
   release instead of the dirty canonical checkout. Manifest
   `6f84fc3e8272357815f6792f6ae74a8c8bfadfa9d9df22abcb17a823372d9ae6`

   `04757a25…8d920`, natural Telegram `35095`, and owner exit 0. Replay created
   no publication, distribution row, receipt, or Telegram message; the one
   concurrent job observed during replay was an unrelated `@obou.anicca` 2h
   metrics event. The shared TikTok metrics owner initially failed because the
   stable release lacked `ws`; importing the 196 KiB version 8.21.0 dependency
   from another immutable LM release restored exit 0 without a canonical or
   OpenClaw runtime dependency. This exact post is registered as pending at 2h
   `2026-08-26T08:40:11.030Z`, 24h, 72h, 7d, and daily; no pending value is
   reported as zero or success.
   **Anicca main Instagram first 3/day slot done:** commit `83118d2f8` changes
   only this LM lane from one 19:10 slot to 08:10/13:10/19:10 JST; focused and
   shared ledger/manifest tests pass 46/46. The stable-release LM label and

   **Anicca JP4 TikTok first live slot done:** the stable-release LM label and
   manifest `e27bd324732525b81ea82185e5b9ab59c2a6f57443e6f279d20076719da8e53b`
   arm exactly five selected routes at 3/day; 17 holds remain 0/day. The first
   15:15 run correctly rejected shared creative identity already published by
   `@anicca.jp`. A JP4-only immutable pack `dd0dc38d…14e7ed3f` preserves the
   approved hook text/title/hashtags/media/caption but namespaces hook IDs as
   `AJ-JP4-CARD-*`; no dedupe rule is weakened. Creative

   TikTok metrics registered 2h `2026-08-26T08:55:39.858Z`, 24h, 72h, 7d,

   incorrectly classified `public_url=unavailable` as Instagram; commit
   `e68a08ade` uses the immutable `tiktok_*` snapshot kind, passes 17/17, and
   real owner exit 0 sent the slideshow 2h natural Telegram `35136` without
   blocking JP4 discovery.
   **Anicca HE TikTok first live slot done:** the stable-release LM label and
   manifest `048847214e3676e1b4252bb4fdd639f67484c37643ab5795a717f48aa4fd39b6`

   `35a31331…8bdf96f` preserves the approved content/media/caption and namespaces
   hook IDs as `AJ-HE-CARD-*`, preventing cross-account TikTok effect collisions
   without weakening dedupe. Creative `AJ-HE-CARD-001-35a15c7ce990` published

   **Anicca EN Card Instagram first live slot done:** commit `4c1871309` gives
   `@anicca.encards` exactly 08:45/12:45/21:30 JST and a dedicated LM label.
   The first kickstart correctly failed before provider with `local ledger job
   id collision`, proving the one-hook/one-media canary pack could not sustain
   daily publication. Commit `1b933f919` adds optional hook-to-approved-media
   binding without changing legacy pack behavior. Direct frame inspection
   rejects Japanese v1 and approves English Card v2/v3/v4; LM-only pack
   `e204995d…e0820e` binds every hook to its exact mode-0600 object, so runtime
   reads no OpenClaw path/env/assets. Creative `EN-CARD-V2-e678c823480f`
   published as exact Postiz API `PUBLISHED` row `cmt9rbish00qylf0yw6gt9ulr`
   at `https://www.instagram.com/reel/Dcfph70jorc/`, integration `cmpc3gx…`,
   matching caption, natural Telegram `35175`, and owner exit 0. Replay kept
   jobs `907→907`, receipts `294→294`, distribution `24→24`, with generation,
   publication, and Telegram all `created=false`. Manifest
   `ce4e9b4d…87f89c` arms exactly seven routes and retains 17 holds at 0/day.
   Commit `845b57c4b` registers the exact EN Card metric lane; the metrics plist
   was corrected from the dirty canonical checkout to fixed release
   `7eb86d63b…f29a5f1`, interval 1800, exit 0. Reel `Dcfph70jorc` now has 2h
   `2026-08-26T09:13:53.435Z`, 24h, 72h, 7d, and daily pending ownership.
   **Next atomic item:** enable and verify only Anicca EN Widget Instagram
   `@anicca.en`; every other selected destination stays unchanged until its
   exact effect, natural Telegram, replay 0, and metric ownership are terminal.
9. Keep the daily metrics loop running for every healthy account: social post and
   account metrics, 2h/24h/72h/7d windows, and natural Telegram. Unsupported or
   empty metrics remain source-labelled `unavailable`.
10. Join each immutable creative/account/campaign lineage with ASC installs,
    RevenueCat trials/subscriptions/proceeds, and product activation/retention.
    Unattributed values remain unattributed; timing alone is not attribution.
11. Close the bounded self-improvement loop independently for Honne EN, Honne JA,
    and Anicca: change one hook/title variable, keep stable assignment, compare
    attributed outcomes, keep/revert, and prove the next creative consumed the
    decision. Never select winners across products.
12. Finish daily and weekly natural-language Telegram reports covering posting,
    misses, duplicates, social metrics, installs, activation, trials, paid,
    proceeds, attribution coverage, and the next bounded hook change.
13. Prove a continuous owner soak: every selected available destination produces
    three daily opportunities, correct-content publication receipts, replay 0,
    due metrics, attributed app outcomes, bounded next-hook consumption, and
    natural daily/weekly Telegram without silent misses or duplicates.
14. Only after that full three/day 24/7 loop is proven, retire legacy ownership
    while retaining disabled artifacts as rollback evidence. Do not enable,
    kickstart, stop, restart, or delete legacy OpenClaw/launchd jobs during this
    recovery. Order 14 terminal is the definition of the mobile-app marketing
    loop being done; no additional hidden recovery TODO remains.
Controls are restored to fence closed and armed 0. API-only operation is enforced by removing the CDP/
browser fallback from profile resolution; a profile-only result now fails fast
after the bounded API/CLI readback instead of holding the effect fence open for
repeated browser attempts. The only next action is reconciliation of this exact
existing effect under the photo-carousel acceptance rule; no new publication
effect is allowed.

Postiz implementation evidence removes the remaining ambiguity about that
numeric suffix. The cloned upstream `gitroomhq/postiz-app` at commit
`81af6c9761f2c50e4741438a9e31bda222b32d2c` shows TikTok Business photo/video
rows can retain `p_pub_url~...` / `v_pub_url~...` as the **share/publish ID**;
`postAnalytics` must call TikTok's private provider-token publish-status API to
resolve it to `post_ids[0]` before querying the native item. Therefore
`7678198747632977937` must not be interpolated into `/video/<id>` and is not a
native direct URL. The public Postiz post-analytics route currently returns an
empty array and does not expose the resolved item ID. The exact blocker is now
provider readback capability, not publication uncertainty: without a public
Postiz response containing the resolved TikTok item ID or a caption-matching
native API artifact, R2 cannot truthfully transition from unknown to present.

The exact upstream defect is narrower still: the normal `tiktok.provider.ts`
`postAnalytics` path resolves only release IDs containing `v_pub_url`; it does
not resolve the photo form's `p_pub_url`. It therefore sends the share/publish
ID to TikTok `video/query`, which returns no row and surfaces as public Postiz
analytics `[]`. The public integration response contains only id/name/identifier/
picture/disabled/profile and no provider token or resolved item ID. Postiz's
`/posts/:id/missing` path is also inapplicable because repository mutation and
lookup are deliberately restricted to rows whose stored release ID already
equals `missing`; this row retains `p_pub_url~v2…`. Exact-caption web search is
also empty. Thus no safe public Postiz API call can currently perform the
private provider-token status resolution. Do not overwrite the release ID,
invent a `/video/` URL, expose an integration token, or create another effect.

**Completed immediately preceding code item:** MKT-09R9-14 / Order 24F9 extends
the shared native-carousel boundary for the single frozen TikTok photo lane and
adds a thin `anicca-en-slideshow-tiktok-canary.js` wrapper. Postiz transport now
accepts ordered JPEG carousels for TikTok, rejects non-JPEG media, preserves the
six-item order, supplies the exact hook title, and retains DIRECT_POST. Job and
receipt contracts bind platform/account/integration/pack/media/caption and accept
only direct `@anicca_slideshow/video/<id>` URLs. Target-only manifest/fence
control restores armed 0/closed after a simulated exact effect; Telegram remains
held without native verification. JS adapter/runner 25/25 and Python transport
20/20 pass; syntax/diff checks pass; provider/Telegram effects during code stage
are 0.

**Completed immediately preceding pack item:** MKT-09R9-13 / Order 24F8 rejects
all nine historical Postiz JPEGs as publication pack candidates because original
resolution inspection proves their hook text extends beyond both horizontal
edges. A corrected six-slide EN carousel retains only a clean crop of the exact
forest visual family and places complete safe-area copy: procrastination hook,
brain/discomfort explanation, smaller-task instruction, two-minute action,
momentum reframe, and Anicca CTA. Full contact-sheet inspection passes. Pack

**Completed immediately preceding classification:** MKT-09R9-12 / Order 24F7
classifies TikTok `@anicca_slideshow` as Anicca iOS / EN / `slideshow` /
`mental-health-photo-post`. The enabled Postiz integration has 13 rows: nine
published and four error. All nine published rows are TikTok photo publications,
zero videos, with the same English mental-health hashtag caption and title
`words you needed to hear today`. Postiz details prove one 1024x1536 JPEG per
row. Full nine-image inspection shows a coherent forest background with distinct
English mental-health hook overlays; repeated rows also reuse byte-identical
assets. Postiz still exposes only a profile URL plus `p_pub_url` suffix, so no
direct native URL or success is inferred. Evidence

**Completed immediately preceding classification:** MKT-09R9-11 / Order 24F6
keeps TikTok `@anicca_buddha` on terminal hold at 0/day. Postiz API reports an
enabled integration named `アニッチャ お笑い`, 114 rows: 93 published and 21
error. The published set is not one coherent lane: 88 are six-image Japanese
mental-strength slideshows through `2026-07-23`, followed by five separate Life
Manager MP4 promotions from `2026-07-24` through `2026-07-28`. Exact Postiz
detail for `cmrwzmwli006gn20y0boak6md` proves six JPEG assets; full contact-sheet
inspection shows the same personal restaurant photo with Japanese overlay text,
not Buddhist art or an app renderer. Postiz supplies only the TikTok profile URL
plus a `p_pub_url` suffix; oEmbed/native direct caption verification is
unavailable, so no numeric suffix is promoted to success. The old LM daily route
was already moved from this mixed personal account to `@anicca.comedy`.

content classifies as 51 Anicca-app, 40 generic mental-health, 14 separate AI
memorial/tomb product, and one other, across 67 carousel/photo and 39 Reel
effects. Instagram API binds both representative direct GraphSidecars to native
owner `@anicca.bochi`: mental-health `DZSSHHtGjii` and AI memorial
`DZPVAMGFL21`. Full six-slide visual inspection confirms materially different
products/forms, so allowed renderer and approved pack remain null rather than
guessing. Evidence

is mode 0600; manifest remains hold/0-day, fence closed, armed 0, provider and
Telegram effects 0.

The runner now performs this control transition itself: it validates the
closed mode-0600 controls and exact pack-ready lane, saves their exact bytes,
arms only the calculated effect/lane, and restores both files in `finally` on
success or provider failure. Focused control coverage is 22/22 GREEN, including
byte-exact restoration after an unknown provider effect; syntax and diff checks
pass. No live provider or Telegram effect occurred during this repair.

**Completed immediately preceding atomic item:** MKT-09R9-04 / Order 24D
generalizes the existing native-carousel adapter and runner for exactly one
additional immutable EN lane while preserving the JA command. EN identity,
Postiz integration `cmp9pedr700ttqh0yj8o57fog`, six ordered object refs,
caption, approval, and native owner `@anicca.ios` are pinned; alternate
self-consistent refs fail before secret/provider access. Direct `/p/`, native
verification, natural Telegram, and replay contracts are shared rather than
copied. Focused tests are 21/21 GREEN; both production files pass `node
--check`, `git diff --check` passes, and provider/Telegram effects during the
code stage are 0. The existing shared ledger already enforces exact open-fence
effect key plus exact production-armed manifest lane at enqueue and claim, so
no second control implementation is added.

native owner `anicca.ios`, the exact approved caption, `GraphSidecar`, and six
ordered CDN images whose bytes equal all six approved SHA-256 values. Direct
visual inspection confirms the intended hook plus five EN mental-health
affirmations and no Honne/Widget/Card/wrong-locale content. API evidence is

moves only this row from hold to `classified/default-off`, 11 targets/19 holds,
armed 0, fence closed; provider and legacy writes are 0.

Read-only classification proves that no existing route can pass. The live
registry has 30 integrations and eight enabled Instagram profiles:
`obou.anicca`, `anicca.affirmation`, `anicca.encards`, `anicca.jp.videos`,
`anicca.jp1`, `anicca.bochi`, `ani.cca1234`, and `anicca.en`. Their 2,076
historical rows belong to Anicca/Buddhist/affirmation/Card/Widget/Larry content;
none is a dedicated Honne EN product account. Current evidence is
`object://sha256/0023c799443305f76a60beb1dc167e2f466bd02227d2527f394f1b5d08d0e28f`;
it preserves global `6,825`, selected `2,076`, every integration/profile/count,
zero literal Honne-brand rows, and cadence initial `1/day` / healthy maximum
`3/day`. Earlier `e07dbe0a…c93906` and `f89d0be1…554a1` are retained but
superseded; the latter lacked the second fresh-OTP attempt.
Provisioning candidate `@honne_reveal` is username-available and reached the
ordinary email OTP screen. Instagram rejected the Gmail plus-address, then the
owner Gmail OTP was rejected as expired/incorrect; one official resend produced
no new code. A later clean signup session again proved the handle and DOB,
received a new owner-Gmail OTP, and read that latest message body directly;
Instagram still rejected the fresh code as invalid/expired. No account was
created, and no phone, CAPTCHA, recovery, Postiz write, publication, Telegram,
or legacy-job operation occurred. Both isolated browser contexts were closed.
Order 24A remains active until Instagram accepts an ordinary fresh OTP for this
exact account or an independently owned dedicated Honne EN account is
connected; an Anicca route or another product's email/account is never a
fallback.

The owner then removed login/signup from this recovery path and made Postiz
CLI/API the only route authority. API disposition
`object://sha256/2750a67c78b3db28c8f794d034fcb29331a4bdc1435c9483fe0df4a91769ac8e`
is terminal: the 30-row registry contains Honne EN/JA TikTok only, Honne
Instagram `0`, Honne YouTube `0`; Postiz can publish only to an existing
integration. The earlier signup evidence remains historical, but 24A is no
longer blocked on account creation. Missing Honne routes are explicit
`unavailable/missing_integration` and the next existing linked Instagram route
is `@anicca.affirmation`.

**Completed immediately preceding atomic item:** MKT-09R8-13 / Order 23J is

`cmt9d2khz00r1p20yb6qbtvyg` at direct native Reel
`https://www.instagram.com/reel/Dce7_IPlUlr/`; owner is `anicca.ios.jp`, caption
and visible Card/My Path content are correct, natural Telegram is `34651`, and
same-slot publication/message replay is 0. Native video/contact/evidence/
verification objects are `ae07770e…b5640`, `69dca534…58de74`,
`9c8cc26e…85d32e`, and `c73062a4…18bee4`. Immediate Postiz metrics measure
Views `126`, Reach `62`, Likes/Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, Engagement `0%`;
unsupported Impressions/Watch time/Average watch time/Completion remain
unavailable in metric status `ea1f93eb…9a9e8f3`. Commit `e9c460b46` fixes
target-filtered Instagram discovery: the loop now discovers this row exactly
once while skipping valid EN Card and EN/JA Widget rows and still rejects a
malformed JA Card row. Registered due times are 2h `2026-08-26T02:35:50.741Z`,
24h `2026-08-27T00:35:50.741Z`, 72h `2026-08-29T00:35:50.741Z`, and 7d
`2026-09-02T00:35:50.741Z`, plus daily 17:30 JST. Manifest
`marketing-lane-manifest:9213d62a61f8c76539083bd0fe84abf93c82e93d1ed9ad2920ee18dfb20b54df`
changes only this lane to `canary-verified`; it remains default-off, all lanes
armed 0, and fence closed.

The final decoded-frame guard is committed at `d82107c69`: `ffprobe
-count_frames` supplies `nb_read_frames` for both inputs, missing or unequal
decoded counts fail closed, and the existing raw/blur thresholds remain
unchanged. Parent verification passes the full runner suite `32/32`; the
native/source pair independently decodes `312/312` frames and compares true;
fresh adversarial review returns `ship`. Same-slot live replay then returns
publication `created=false` and Telegram `created=false`, reusing message
`34651`; jobs/receipts remain `787/255` with exactly one publication receipt
and one natural message receipt. Commit `e9c460b46` is byte-identical to the
canonical metrics runtime file and its target filter passes `3/3`; a second
fresh adversary returns `ship`. The installed LM metrics plist retains
`StartInterval=1800`, but an immediate non-killing `launchctl kickstart` from
this isolated GUI control plane returns `141 Reentrancy avoided`. No service,
legacy job, plist, or scheduler state is changed; the next natural interval is
the readback point for the deployed filter, while the exact due windows remain
registered rather than being called measured early.

MKT-09R8-13 implementation preflight is complete without an external effect.
The live manifest has exactly one matching `@anicca.jp1` target at integration
`cmn8ycvtn02djqx0ytuisn9mw`, renderer `reelclaw-card`, format
`nudge-card-reel`, state `pack-ready/default-off`; every lane is armed 0 and
the publication fence is closed. Pack `76937db0…fe311c`, caption
`311f9c3d…6ba2eb`, and selected video `35a15c7c…e9a15` resolve from the LM
object store at mode `0600`. All five dedicated Card Instagram env bindings
are unset, while shared `LM_ANICCA_MAIN_PACK_REF` still points to the rejected
source pack and must remain byte-unchanged. Existing standing approval
`3f138ade…831eb7` authorizes the account/form generally but does not bind the
exact pack, caption, video, integration, and creative required by the canary;
an exact immutable approval object is therefore required before arming. Postiz
uses account alias `@anicca.jp1`, but the already established native Instagram
owner is `anicca.ios.jp`; the reused runner must preserve the alias for
manifest/approval/publication identity and verify the separate frozen native
owner at `CaptionUsername`. The minimal implementation is one frozen lane in
the existing canary engine, one thin CLI wrapper, and focused regression tests;
it does not add a publisher, scheduler, or alternate receipt path.

The implementation is now `GREEN` at commits `c8a4b3ebe` and `e105d7cf1`:
the shared canary engine accepts one additional frozen Card lane, keeps
provider alias `@anicca.jp1` separate from native owner `@anicca.ios.jp`, and a
thin dedicated CLI selects only that lane. Focused tests pass `29/29`, including
dedicated-ref isolation, exact raw integration, fail-before-secret/provider,
wrong-owner hold, one natural Telegram release only after native verification,
and same-slot publication/message replay 0. Official Postiz public-API readback
finds the exact integration among 30 rows as `instagram-standalone`, profile
`anicca.jp1`, `disabled=false`. Runtime env, manifest, fence, provider rows,
Telegram publication receipts, scheduler, and legacy state remain unchanged;
fresh adversarial review and the exact runtime approval/preflight are still
required before the one allowed effect.

Fresh adversarial pre-effect review rejects that first GREEN as not yet safe to
run: dedicated env names alone still accepted any mutually consistent
replacement pack and approval instead of the exact selected refs. The same
live preflight also finds host DNS unavailable for `api.postiz.com`; the Python
transport already implements an exact-host/public-IPv4-validated
`LM_POSTIZ_RESOLVE_IP`, but the Node subprocess allowlist omitted that key.
Both are implementation blockers, not reasons to post through a second path.
Exact canary approval
`object://sha256/bb3e2ac385d7c7ed9a2387522ba441ece797fd8bcc9827c9386dcf66db764ee2`
now binds account, integration, pack, creative, video, and caption at mode
`0600`, rooted in standing approval `3f138ade…831eb7`; it creates no external
effect. Before runtime env may be set, the frozen lane must reject every ref
other than pack `76937db0…fe311c`, video `35a15c7c…e9a15`, caption
`311f9c3d…6ba2eb`, and approval `bb3e2ac3…764ee2`, and the focused DNS
allowlist regression must be GREEN. Effect count remains zero.

Those pre-effect blockers are now closed at commits `891d671ab` and
`6f56fe538`. The lane freezes all four exact refs and rejects a mutually
consistent alternate before object reads, secrets, provider access, or state;
the subprocess passes only the existing validated Postiz DNS override key; and
the natural receipt names native owner `@anicca.ios.jp`, never provider alias
`@anicca.jp1`. Parent verification passes widget `30/30` and publication
adapter `16/16`; the final targeted adversary returns `SHIP`. The private
runtime env is mode `0600` and now binds the four exact refs plus validated
Postiz IPv4 `69.46.46.109`; the shared main pack remains byte-identical. Every
object resolves with SHA/mode `0600`, manifest `bbc2bb24…ca124` still has
armed 0 and only the exact lane `pack-ready/default-off`, and the fence remains
closed. The current local ledgers are `780/253` because unrelated owners
continued, but exact job `marketing-video-publication:f4cb935f…aa31f1` and the
creative+caption+approval identity match zero jobs and zero receipts. Immediate
official Postiz readback over 124 August rows finds five rows for the integration
and zero for the exact caption. Native verification binding is absent, so the
first run must hold Telegram. Exactly one effect at immutable logical slot
`2026-08-26T00:33:11.000Z` is authorized next; no other slot or retry is
allowed if its outcome becomes unknown.

At effect time a concurrent owner had already opened the exact same effect
fence. The planned `00:33:11.000Z` invocation therefore failed before provider
access with `publication controls are not closed` and created no second job or
effect. The existing exact job
`marketing-video-publication:f4cb935f…aa31f1` owns actual slot
`2026-08-26T00:33:55.000Z` and is terminal `completed`,
`unknown_effect=false`, with exactly one enqueue/claim/complete sequence and
one receipt. Postiz row `cmt9d2khz00r1p20yb6qbtvyg` has the LF-equivalent
exact caption and direct candidate
`https://www.instagram.com/reel/Dce7_IPlUlr/`. Manifest bytes are restored to
`bbc2bb24…ca124`, target is again `pack-ready/default-off`, all lanes armed 0,
and fence closed at mode `0600`. Native verification remains absent, so
Telegram is correctly held at 0. No retry or second publication is allowed;
only this direct candidate may proceed to native owner/full-video verification.

Native verification is terminal. The captioned embed binds exact native owner
`anicca.ios.jp` and the approved caption; parent full-timeline visual readback
confirms the same woman, hook, Japanese Anicca Card, and My Path ending.
Instagram native MP4 `object://sha256/ae07770e…b5640`, native contact sheet
`object://sha256/69dca534…58de74`, evidence
`object://sha256/9c8cc26e…85d32e`, and verification
`object://sha256/c73062a4…18bee4` are immutable. The first natural Telegram
transport failed before HTTP because system DNS was unavailable; the same
durable message job was sent once through the DNS-resolved transport and
reconciled `present` as message `34651`. A further same-slot replay returns
publication `created=false`, Telegram `created=false`, and the same direct URL
and message ID. No second post exists. The only remaining MKT-09R8-13 failure is
metrics discovery: the collector throws on unrelated valid EN Card and Widget
rows before reaching this valid JA Card row.

**Completed immediately preceding atomic item:** MKT-09R8-12 / Order 23I
reconciled the complete existing Postiz history before any new effect. Read-only
GETs covered `1970-01-01` through `2026-08-27`: pre-2025 and 2025 returned zero,
2026 H1 returned 4,629 rows, July 2,071, and August-to-observation 122. Their
6,822 unique IDs exactly equal the one-shot broad response, with zero duplicate
or missing IDs. Exact integration `cmn8ycvtn02djqx0ytuisn9mw` has 60 rows, but
zero rows match caption object `311f9c3d…6ba2eb`, allowing only provider
omission of its single terminal LF. Therefore zero native-video candidates
exist and none can satisfy the required full-media match
`35a15c7ce990…e9a15`. Corrected immutable absence evidence is
`object://sha256/96a0d7691293e974962e0c69a0975f6ac7ff9a8a500f60569f73f53f7261ce47`.
It resolves the selected video directly from the SHA-verified pack: caption and
pack refs each match zero local ledger lines, while the intentionally reused
video ref appears in 125 job lines and 11 receipt lines; the exact integration
+ caption + pack + video identity matches zero. The earlier evidence
`79dd1fc4…a0b32b8` is retained but superseded because it contained a manually
transcribed non-pack video hash. Global jobs/receipts remain `774/251`; manifest
`bbc2bb24…ca124` remains pack-ready/default-off with armed 0 and the publication
fence remains closed. Provider, Telegram, scheduler, and legacy-job writes are
all zero. The historical
`DcTFx_UjSio` row remains rejected because its caption is different; only the
later dedicated-runner item may create a new exact effect.

**Earlier completed atomic item:** MKT-09R8-11 / Order 23H
audited all four existing JA Card media objects rather than trusting legacy pack
metadata. Source pack `694e3ab6…7d480` is rejected as a runnable pack because
its four `強い人の口癖…` metadata hooks match none of the baked media hooks.
Media 1 `7e24db96…a9ae9` and media 2 `abbbbdea…66782a` end in generic quote
sequences rather than an Anicca Nudge Card and are rejected. Media 3
`5639e148…82a32` is a valid held alternative with baked hook
`やらなきゃいけないのに 動けない自分が嫌になる`. Media 4
`35a15c7ce990…e9a15` is selected: 21 sampled timeline frames collectively show
baked hook `怠けてるんじゃない。脳が限界なだけ。`, the Japanese Anicca
Card, and complete My Path transition without blank, clipping, foreign language,
or CTA.
Its new exact caption object `311f9c3d…6ba2eb` matches that baked hook and ends
in LF. Account-bound modern pack `76937db0…fe311c` reuses the existing video
bytes, binds only `@anicca.jp1` / exact integration / `reelclaw-card` /
`nudge-card-reel`, and points to visual evidence `6ddf6284…9149dc`.
Full four-candidate evidence is `object://sha256/e0a7b1ab98bbdab7430cfaf9fcf9f6448581aa44d152427cf82314e07ceeb06f`;
all 15 referenced objects are SHA-exact/mode `0600`, caption bytes match the
pack, and this pack operation leaves jobs/receipts unchanged at `771/250`.
During later adversarial review, an unrelated Honne `marketing.video.generate`
job with `effect_class=none` added only enqueue/claim/complete plus one artifact
receipt, moving the global ledger to `774/251`; it created no provider or
message effect and does not change this pack result. The prior direct Instagram canary
uses the selected media but caption `強い人の口癖、5つだけ`; it therefore
proves native account/Card identity but no longer passes the exact content
success gate. Manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:bbc2bb247ddb91ffd5b1b195e8f0cfa02bcdd96ab31bc93d7b1c32301f4ca124`
downgrades only this lane from historical `verified` to truthful `pack-ready`;
actual 0/day/default-off/armed 0 and fence closed remain unchanged. The shared
`LM_ANICCA_MAIN_PACK_REF` is not changed because it also feeds TikTok; the
exact Instagram pack must use a dedicated binding before cadence arm.
Fresh read-only adversarial review returned `SHIP`: it independently checked all
four timeline classifications, metadata/baked-hook mismatch, media 4 selection,
LF-exact caption, account-bound approval, all referenced SHA/mode `0600`, media
byte reuse, target-only manifest downgrade, armed 0/fence closed, unchanged
shared pack ref, and the next read-only reconciliation gate.

**Earlier completed atomic item:** MKT-09R8-10 / Order 23G
classifies Anicca iOS / JA / Instagram Card Postiz alias `@anicca.jp1` and
native owner `@anicca.ios.jp` as one lane only: integration
`cmn8ycvtn02djqx0ytuisn9mw`, renderer `reelclaw-card`, format
`nudge-card-reel`, form `nudge-card`, and pack
`anicca-ios-reelclaw-card-ja.pack.json`. The live Postiz registry returns the
integration exactly once as enabled `instagram-standalone`; five target rows in
the measured range are direct Reels with Japanese Anicca/self-care captions.
Only the known canary below is visually classified as Card. Direct
`https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcTFx_UjSio/` binds native owner
`anicca.ios.jp`, exact caption `強い人の口癖、5つだけ`, and the approved
woman → Japanese Anicca Card → My Path flow. Instagram's current transcode is
preserved as `object://sha256/ae07770e5a74f9ff04ee68e2504cdb040c67c3c7e8fef06fcd38c2ea85fb5640`

Parent full-timeline visual inspection matches the approved media; the generic
strict comparator does not pass (`2 fps`, 21 frames, SSIM min `0.921209`, mean
`0.956471`), so this is classification evidence only and is not promoted into
a terminal native-verification claim. The first immutable classification object
`48fc8782…e2e34` remains retained but is superseded because its embedded caption
omitted the approved caption object's final LF and its history-family wording
was too broad. Corrected evidence
`object://sha256/5728925f0480b785b182e9c7dc63e27ef07bb296f536fd47eadad825657c5c6c`
is byte-identical to caption object `bdef736e…601d9`, including final LF, and
limits the Card visual claim to the known canary.
The existing manifest already has the exact assignment and stronger historical
`verified` canary state, so no manifest bytes are changed or downgraded. Target
is 1/day at 19:10 JST; actual remains 0/day/default-off/armed 0, fence closed.
The targeted runtime path reads LM env/object refs and scans zero OpenClaw
paths/env/assets. `launchctl print` is currently unavailable with GUI bootstrap
error 141, so no claim is made that either plist is registered; neither plist
nor any legacy job was changed. Fresh read-only adversarial review returned
`SHIP`: it verified the corrected final-LF caption, alias/native-owner binding,
runtime `anicca-ios` to manifest `anicca` normalization, existing receipt/media
lineage, classification-only SSIM scope, default-off/armed 0/fence closed state,
zero external writes, and zero targeted OpenClaw runtime dependencies.

**Earlier completed atomic item:** MKT-09R8-09 / Order 23F ran
exactly one controlled canary for Anicca iOS / JA / Instagram
`@anicca.jp.videos` using
pack `object://sha256/16d4452d5e3d408d76b915b76e80bf014a57b6354bf133391c785542db6f7696`
and Postiz integration `cmmzzg2es0539p30ycb94ayx0`. Before the one provider
call, a dedicated fail-closed runner must bind the exact account, integration,
pack/video/caption SHAs, one logical slot, open effect fence, and temporary
target-only arm, then restore both controls on every terminal path. Success
requires a caption-matching direct Instagram Reel whose native full video
matches the approved bytes, followed by one natural-language Telegram receipt,
replay 0, and explicit metric-source status. Profile URLs, numeric releases,
Postiz `PUBLISHED`, or HTTP 200 alone never pass. No scheduler, fan-out, retry,
second account, or legacy-job action is allowed.

The MKT-09R8-09 **runner and native-evidence gates are green; its sole external
effect is complete and no second effect is allowed**.
Copying the 500-line EN runner was rejected. The existing Widget canary is now
shared through immutable EN and JA lane definitions, while the new
`anicca-ja-widget-canary.js` is only a thin exact-lane CLI wrapper. The JA
definition pins `@anicca.jp.videos`, integration
`cmmzzg2es0539p30ycb94ayx0`, manifest account
`anicca-ios-ja-widget-instagram`, locale `ja`, the exact four LM object env
keys, creative `JA-WIDGET-CANARY-0c67b0a4d1de`, and approved pack name
`anicca-ios-reelclaw-widget-ja.pack.json`. Only the exact frozen EN or JA lane
object is accepted; a cloned caller-supplied definition is rejected before env,
secret, provider, or state access. TDD RED first observed the absent JA wrapper,
then separately observed the cloned-lane hole. Parent GREEN is focused 19/19
and combined publication/ledger/manifest/liveness/object-store 83/83, with
syntax and diff checks green. Tests prove exact JA pack/approval/account/
integration identity, exact Postiz integration with no profile-state path,
target-only temporary arm and fence, byte/mode restoration on success and
unknown provider failure, native verification before one Telegram, and
same-slot publication/message replay 0. The live read-only preflight still has
integration enabled for profile `anicca.jp.videos`, zero target rows and zero
exact-caption rows among 47 Postiz rows in the last 36 hours, zero matching
local jobs/receipts, manifest `pack-ready` with armed 0, and fence closed.
Fresh adversarial review returned `SHIP`. Exact approval
`object://sha256/f7b1109d72fa4514419e9c15e16c4ae1910697a6f31526767dbd76b6ba52c855`
is SHA-exact at mode `0600` and binds only this account, integration, pack,
creative, video, and caption. The next allowed state is the final
closed-control preflight followed by at most one provider effect; provider
writes remain 0. That final preflight now passes: the live integration is
enabled for `anicca.jp.videos`; 47 recent Postiz rows contain zero target rows
and zero exact-caption rows; matching local jobs/receipts remain zero; all four
objects are SHA-exact/mode `0600`; manifest `d3ee329a…906b9` is pack-ready with
armed 0 and the fence is closed. A separate no-effect transport probe then
reproduced system DNS failure inside Python `urllib` before any HTTP request,
while the same Postiz API and integration return HTTP 200 through an exact
current DoH-resolved address. Provider writes therefore remain 0. The active
blocker fix is a minimal TDD, opt-in, exact-Postiz-host DNS override; the canary
does not start until that path is GREEN, reviewed, and the closed-control
preflight passes again. TDD is now GREEN: the override accepts only one public
IPv4 literal, remaps only exact `api.postiz.com` within a scoped context, keeps
the HTTPS hostname/TLS identity unchanged, and restores the original resolver
on exit. Focused Postiz tests pass 19/19, combined distribution tests pass
39/39, syntax/diff checks pass, and a real read-only Python `urllib` probe now
returns HTTP 200 for the exact integration before restoring the resolver.
Provider writes remain 0. Fresh adversarial review is the only remaining code
gate before the final preflight and one effect. That fresh review returned
`SHIP`: it confirmed public-IPv4 and exact-host scope, preserved TLS hostname,
resolver restoration on exceptional paths, no material `_publish` behavior
change, and no relevant single-process CLI concurrency leak. The next allowed
action is the repeated closed-control preflight followed by at most one effect.
The repeated preflight passes with the same enabled integration, 47 recent rows
but zero target/exact-caption rows, zero local jobs/receipts, pack-ready manifest
`d3ee329a…906b9`, armed 0, and a closed fence, all control files mode `0600`.
The initial CLI spelling `2026-08-25T22:28:41Z` was rejected by the runner's
canonical-instant parser before env, state, or provider access. Postiz target
rows, local jobs/receipts, manifest bytes, armed count, and fence all remained
unchanged. The same instant's required canonical spelling is the one immutable
logical slot `2026-08-25T22:28:41.000Z`. This input correction is not a second
effect; no other instant, retry after provider access, account, or integration
is authorized.

That sole provider effect is complete as Postiz row `cmt98nnld02pdp20ypm3ohqna`
at direct `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcetvubDA4Z/`; manifest bytes are
restored to `d3ee329a…906b9`, armed 0, and the fence is closed. Telegram remains
correctly held at 0. The public captioned embed binds owner
`anicca.jp.videos` and the exact approved caption. Native MP4
`object://sha256/4d450f923746e4ed59837f6593674512d09ebad0755d93f9fa6a506053102154`
is 17.831 seconds H.264/AAC; the full-video comparator passes and parent visual
inspection of both 36-frame contact sheets confirms the exact Japanese hook,
woman, and complete Anicca lock-screen Widget installation. Native contact
sheet is `object://sha256/24e62343ba84f6b645a9351fe8cc89028e254bdcbdb7ac16a6cf7755d9ac023a`.
The first immutable evidence/verification pair `a615234d…473eb0` /
`e1dae40f…fa34d2` remains retained but is superseded because its embedded
caption omitted the approved caption object's final LF. A fresh live readback
again proves exact owner/caption/direct URL and fetches the same native SHA.
Corrected evidence
`object://sha256/65401d93fbd845bdbcd957673c2f2daa6e42b1d0df2184d03bc1a5392213c1f9`
is byte-identical to caption object `b57c4f89…e1c6d`, including its final LF;
corrected verification is
`object://sha256/1980f2309b600d948262f1f3aed8544ee6ec7ea2ee2b19a160d5ed2d4f8a318f`.
Both are SHA-exact/mode `0600`. The remaining runtime gate is to make the
runner's live embed/media re-fetch tolerate the same DNS outage and Instagram's
double-escaped `video_url` without weakening host/TLS/content checks. No second
publication is allowed; the existing receipt is the only input to this TDD fix.
That fix is now GREEN and fresh-review `SHIP`. It decodes JSON-style Unicode
escapes only inside the extracted media URL, rejects credentials/ports/fragments,
falls back only on DNS errors, accepts only valid CNAME rows plus public IPv4 A
records, disables ambient proxies, and invokes bounded/no-redirect HTTPS curl
with `--resolve` so Host/TLS SNI remain native. Focused runner tests pass 25/25
and combined tests pass 89/89. A real fallback read gets embed/media HTTP 200 and
the fetched native SHA is exactly `4d450f…02154`. At that state, the only
allowed action was a same-slot replay with corrected verification
`1980f230…8a318f`; it could create only the one natural Telegram receipt and no
provider effect.
That replay is now terminal: natural publication Telegram `34523` contains the
same direct URL, and a further same-slot replay returns publication 0, message
0, and Telegram transport calls 0. The message job has exactly one
enqueue/claim/complete sequence and one receipt. Immediate Postiz post analytics
measures Views `173`, Reach `134`, Likes `1`, and Saves/Comments/Shares `0`;
account analytics is HTTP 200 with an empty response and remains `unavailable`,
not zero. Product attribution is also unavailable, while 2h/24h/72h/7d owner
registration remains explicitly `pending`, in metric status
`object://sha256/fab4b0ed640af823fe99ee13b5b65248cca1c8ad728951a9750fcf1e5c2539c6`.
Manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:1d9ce1df6b639bf6a0ef282a61f5ca506b8748dfe0390cda5b378bee19ec8d15`
records only this target's `canary-verified` transition; all lanes remain
default-off/armed 0 and the fence remains closed.

The MKT-09R8-06 external effect is **terminal verified**.
The dedicated runner and combined publication/ledger/liveness tests are green,
the live target integration is enabled, the exact caption has 0 target rows in
the last 24 hours, all 9 lanes remain unarmed, and the fence remains closed.
The first adversarial review rejected arbitrary evidence bytes and missing
runner-owned manifest/fence restoration. TDD now proves exact target-only controls,
byte/mode restoration on normal success and provider failure, receipt replay with
no arm, and the live manifest's separate internal account alias and native profile.
The second fresh review's self-attestation defect is now closed: the runner fetches
the captioned Reel and native CDN MP4 over HTTPS, binds its bytes by SHA, rejects
caller match booleans, and applies ffprobe/ffmpeg comparison. Parent read-only E2E
against a real Instagram Caption embed and CDN MP4 passed, while the same-caption
historical Reel correctly failed against the different approved person/content.
The third review's author-anchor, first-second-only comparison, and final embed URL
defects are closed under TDD. The fourth review's bounded truncation path is also
closed: duration tolerance is capped at 0.25 seconds, both streams are sampled at
2 fps across the longer timeline, at most one terminal frame may be absent, every
compared SSIM score must be at least 0.95, and the 15.0-second versus 13.5-second
regression fails closed. The fifth fresh read-only review returned SHIP after
focused 12/12 and combined 76/76 tests. At that pre-effect gate, MKT-09R8-06 was
the only active item and required the exact final approval object plus closed
control readback before its one Postiz call. No retry, fan-out, scheduler arm,
or legacy-job action was allowed.

The exact final approval is now
`object://sha256/9c7514fc4c49f4632c0f35cb25f692fd9106960500ae936dfefc89aaddac01a3`
at mode `0600`; readback binds only the approved pack, video/caption digests,
`@anicca.en`, and integration `cmn8y95rg02d2qx0y09bbk5pb`. A fresh
read-only preflight found 30 live integrations with that Instagram integration
enabled, 32 Postiz rows in the last 24 hours but zero for the target integration
and zero exact-caption rows, and no exact local job or receipt. Manifest
`marketing-lane-manifest:11ace472e123b4f025bce13d10a61b89f1d851863dd907107daadade5d3058be`
still has 9 targets, 21 holds, and armed 0; the target remains `pack-ready`
and `default-off`, and the publication fence remains closed. The next and only
allowed external effect is the single exact canary using logical slot
`2026-08-25T21:03:33.000Z`.

That single call created Postiz row `cmt95nd89023fp20yna8g8olx` and direct
candidate `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcekGtmjmOf/`; local job
`marketing-video-publication:e98e8552c03c8a16d0aa7ff211fbe1af630a25ddc917b7fe7dc7f5b8640ad528`
is `completed`, `unknown_effect=false`, and the reconciled receipt records
`published_at=2026-08-25T21:06:17.106Z`. This is not yet success: the LM
Telegram publication receipt is held until exact native owner, caption, and
full-video visual bytes pass. The runner restored manifest
`marketing-lane-manifest:11ace472e123b4f025bce13d10a61b89f1d851863dd907107daadade5d3058be`
with armed 0 and the target `default-off`/`pack-ready`, restored the fence
closed, and preserved both control files at mode `0600`. No retry or second
publication is allowed.

Native readback now binds exact `CaptionUsername=anicca.en`, the normalized
approved caption, and CDN host `scontent-nrt1-1.cdninstagram.com`; imported
candidate bytes have SHA-256
`90f8e8413ffa0ae0e539a7a4f00160031f8f479998ac35c09dc99ebb26dcd390`,
H.264/AAC 720x1280, and duration 15.102708 seconds. Parent visual inspection of
all 30 half-second source and native frames found the same woman, English hook,
lock-screen screens, and complete Anicca Widget installation sequence. The
first comparator result was false because Instagram color/recompression produced
four frames just below 0.95 (minimum 0.947961; mean 0.971818), not because the
content differed. TDD now adds an Instagram-like recompression regression and
uses a per-frame floor of 0.945 while retaining the 0.25-second duration,
full-timeline, changed-tail, and truncation gates. Focused 12/12, combined 76/76,
and the actual native comparison are green; a fresh adversarial review was
required before evidence import or Telegram release. That fresh review returned
SHIP: it independently reproduced the actual 30-frame score distribution and
the new Instagram-like regression, reran focused 12/12 and combined 76/76, and
confirmed that wrong solid content, changed tail, and 15-to-13.5-second
truncation still fail closed. The immutable evidence import and runner live
refetch passed. LM natural-language Telegram `34435` carries the same direct
URL; same-slot replay created publication 0 and message 0 with the same message
ID. Native video
`object://sha256/90f8e8413ffa0ae0e539a7a4f00160031f8f479998ac35c09dc99ebb26dcd390`,

Immediate Postiz post analytics measured Views `14`, Reach `0`, Saves `0`,

zero. Corrected metric status

claimed as a running loop. Final manifest

records `canary-verified`, default-off, target limit 2/day, actual scheduled
0/day, armed 0, and 21 holds; the fence is closed.

MKT-09R8-07 is now **terminal classified** for exactly one next account. Live
Postiz integration `cmmzzg2es0539p30ycb94ayx0` is enabled and binds Instagram
profile `@anicca.jp.videos`. Direct native Reel
`https://www.instagram.com/reel/DbYPO6SoOQU/` binds that owner to the exact
Japanese Widget caption; visual inspection across the full 17.83-second native
video shows a Japanese hook, iPhone lock-screen customization, and the visible
Anicca Widget installation flow. A second direct Reel,
`https://www.instagram.com/reel/DbY5kvdICul/`, proves the same account also has
a distinct Japanese affirmation/Card sequence, so that creative is explicitly
excluded from this lane instead of inheriting the mixed history. The two
disabled legacy Widget JA crons remain untouched; their 08:05 and 18:20 JST
cadence supplies the healthy target only, while their obsolete Instagram
integration ID is rejected. Manifest
`marketing-lane-manifest:20e4570fe02f5675465fa3846b21133d346e36f31d0856a68f3625164557997a`
validates at mode `0600` with 10 targets, 20 holds, every target `default-off`,
armed 0, and the fence closed. Provider, Telegram, scheduler, and legacy-job
writes were 0; actual cadence remains 0/day.

MKT-09R8-08 is now **terminal pack-ready** for that same account. The disabled
legacy renderer was inspected read-only and rejected as runtime code because it
randomly chose `widget-ja/v*.mp4`, selected a separate LRU caption hook without
rendering it into the video, fanned out to TikTok/Instagram/YouTube, and masked
publisher failures with `|| true`. All four source videos were inspected across
their full timelines. `v1` is the forbidden affirmation/Card flow, `v3` ends
before the complete Widget selection, and `v2` has a different hook. Only `v4`
has the exact Japanese hook `ロック画面にアファメーション / 置けるの知らなかった`
plus the complete Anicca Widget installation sequence seen in direct native Reel
`https://www.instagram.com/reel/DbYPO6SoOQU/`. At 2 fps across the full shared
timeline, source/native SSIM is minimum `0.977367` and mean `0.991391`.

The prior seven-target manifest remains historical state evidence |
| MKT-09B1 | Repair and read back the exact selected YouTube integration; no publication | YouTube `@anicca-jp` (`cmn1oukj9012nnq0yqhouc3ib`) only | **skipped by owner instruction; 0/day.** The first exact canary effect remains terminal `absent`: local job `marketing-video-publication:272c9640dbb10b04706d3f4a52335c8a54d92e764485b66a10fcedf137bfba00`, Postiz row `cmt41nl0809imqp0yx5rls3zp`, provider state `ERROR`, error `Refresh channel needed`, no direct URL/release ID/Telegram receipt, and no retry. OAuth diagnosis remains evidence only; no owner login is required while the lane is skipped |
| MKT-09B2 | Publish and verify one selected Anicca JA YouTube Shorts canary | YouTube `@anicca-jp` (`cmn1oukj9012nnq0yqhouc3ib`) only | **skipped by owner instruction; 0/day.** No replacement effect, success receipt, metrics claim, or scheduler arm |
| MKT-10A | Read and persist the complete available metric surface for one verified account before arming it | Honne EN TikTok `@honne_reveal` only | **done —** 24h snapshot `object://sha256/b6dee2a5bf17b36e5e66999f25de0d534afbaa0da40ef547dce3e6c4985edb05` binds the verified direct URL, `account_id`, caption, and native evidence `object://sha256/0021ec3f8d3d9cb3b37de2092065f6e2a52049ba68715f17021f6dde99532de9`; identity and account metrics use separate non-colliding fields. Native post metrics: views `187`, likes `6`, comments `0`, shares `0`, saves `0`, derived engagement `3.21%`; reach/watch time/completion are explicitly unsupported/unavailable. Postiz post analytics is unavailable because its stored `v_pub_file~…` release ID returns an empty array and its correction endpoint only accepts `releaseId=missing`; this is not converted to zero. Postiz account metrics: followers `5`, following `7`, total likes `1,427`, videos `177`, and latest-20-video aggregate views `4,266`, likes `136`, comments `0`, shares `0`. The 2h snapshot was not captured and is `source_delayed`; 72h/7d remain pending; no publication or cadence change |
| MKT-10B | Make the verified full-metric native fallback repeatable in Rockstar_ibot | Honne EN TikTok `@honne_reveal` only | **done —** `tiktok-native-metric-source.js` and its thin CLI reject wrong direct URL/video/account/caption and unsafe local identities before persistence; the real 24h snapshot first returned `created=true`, replay returned `created=false`, and wrong caption/account/video all failed closed. Immutable repeatable snapshot `object://sha256/dfabd2c6456a1eae0540b69973b0f9424fd8f1dd31ba3db8a22f1a7b2fb550d2` preserves views/likes/comments/shares/saves, derived engagement, and explicit unavailable reach/watch time/completion; no publication or cadence change |
| MKT-10C | Enable one healthy account at its §8.8.1 channel limit | Honne EN TikTok `@honne_reveal` only | **done —** schema-v2 manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:89d39d96bfa0369add58de7dac45164b40f4ed29022ad157c38e524763dc0b5d` arms exactly `@honne_reveal` at `target_daily_limit=3`; five other target lanes and all 22 holds are unchanged. New LM-owned trigger `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-honne-en` has only 07:00/11:00/20:30 Asia/Tokyo calendar events, reads only `~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/.env`, and logs only below the LM state root. Readback immediately after bootstrap was `not running`, `runs=0`, `last exit=(never exited)` with unchanged job/receipt line counts, so arming itself created no post. The legacy ReelClaw label remains disabled and untouched; focused manifest/cycle tests pass 18/18 |
| MKT-10 | Enable the §8.8.1 three-per-day policy only after each account canary and metrics health gate passes | every production-armed selected destination | exactly 3/day on every selected available TikTok/Instagram destination, enabled one account and one slot at a time; no duplicate effects and no silent misses; skipped/missing routes remain 0/day |
| MKT-11-HJA1 | Read and persist the complete available 24h metric surface | Honne JA TikTok `@honnevideo` only | **done —** direct native account/video/caption match persisted post Views `1,035`, Likes `11`, Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, derived engagement `1.06%`, and explicit unavailable reach/watch time/completion. Postiz post analytics returned HTTP 200 with an empty array and is `unavailable/empty_response`, not zero or success. Postiz account analytics measured Followers `4`, Following `8`, Total Likes `923`, Videos `278`, and latest-20 aggregate Views `5,650`, Likes `42`, Comments/Shares `0`. Composite snapshot `object://sha256/0b0433ff74d9c4d6f387c0158d4ce416b53fdebe61fb3f1f2ef9d07e3babfd47`; native identity evidence `object://sha256/19563bba9c566bfb5f3bd88c1341131de9e36089d5a076561f05a8212d5d004f`; native replay `created=false`; job/receipt line counts unchanged at 84/24; Honne JA remains default-off |
| MKT-11-HJA2 | Make the combined post/account metric read repeatable before cadence eligibility | Honne JA TikTok `@honnevideo` only | **done —** the existing `tiktok-native-metrics-read.js` accepts the exact integration and provider row as additional identity keys, reads TikTok embedded JSON plus Postiz account/post analytics, and writes one mode-`0600` immutable combined snapshot. Real first run created `object://sha256/72e1665d65656a2071174ed6caa882c3834c13de5e0fc32d4195ca601eb7551d`; replay returned `created=false`; wrong caption failed before provider persistence. Empty Postiz post analytics remains `unavailable/empty_response`; all eight account metrics and every available native post metric are source-labelled; a future non-empty Postiz result preserves its Views/Likes/Comments/Shares instead of discarding them. Focused tests pass 2/2; job/receipt counts remain 84/24; no cadence change |
| MKT-11-HJA3 | Enable the next healthy account at its TikTok limit | Honne JA TikTok `@honnevideo` only | **done —** schema-v2 manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:902c5db24142d764ab064bfc252dc2428b510798106c8abeae0a7f97df6f33ae` arms exactly Honne EN and Honne JA at `target_daily_limit=3`; four Anicca targets and all 22 holds are unchanged. New LM-owned JA trigger has only 08:30/12:30/21:30 Asia/Tokyo events, reads/logs only below the LM state root, and has no RunAtLoad. Immediate readback was `not running`, `runs=0`, `last exit=(never exited)` with job/receipt counts unchanged at 84/24, so arming created no post. Legacy JA labels remain disabled and untouched; focused tests pass 2/2 |
| MKT-11-AJM1 | Read the complete native metric surface before any Anicca main cadence change | Anicca main TikTok `@anicca.jp` only | **done —** native embedded JSON matched direct URL `7676422253638176020`, account `@anicca.jp`, video ID, and exact Anicca JA card caption `強い人の口癖、5つだけ`. The immutable 24h snapshot `object://sha256/aac182917b92e10888acb140e926ff9b41e488d29963c0f3c04924b6ed3e8bb5` records Views `108`, measured Likes/Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, derived engagement `0%`, and explicit unavailable Reach/Watch time/Completion. Replay returned `created=false`; wrong caption failed closed; mode is `0600`; job/receipt counts remain 84/24; Anicca main remains default-off. Initial object import hit ENOSPC, so only the regenerable npm cache was cleaned; retry succeeded without deleting runtime evidence |
| MKT-11-AJM2 | Read the complete Postiz account/post source through the combined collector | Anicca main TikTok `@anicca.jp` only | **done —** exact integration `cmp9sdev5012voh0y58qs45xc` and provider row `cmt2s158o02kyph0yvht8d8wd` are bound into combined snapshot `object://sha256/631074806072b8939a77051189ca70b7122fe4d8e604de8b2169fcdd3a4a248b`. Postiz post analytics returned an empty array and remains `unavailable/empty_response`; account analytics measured Followers `257`, Following `33`, Total Likes `17,662`, Videos `470`, and latest-20 aggregate Views `5,296`, Likes `51`, Comments `1`, Shares `2`. Native post metrics remain source-labelled; replay returned `created=false`; mode is `0600`; job/receipt counts remain 84/24; both Anicca TikTok and Instagram remain default-off |
| MKT-11-AJM3 | Enable only the healthy Anicca main TikTok destination | Anicca main TikTok `@anicca.jp` only | **done —** LM-owned label `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-anicca-main-tiktok` is bootstrapped at `08:00/16:00/22:37 JST`, fixed to product `anicca-ios`, format `reelclaw-card`, locale `ja`, integration `cmp9sdev5012voh0y58qs45xc`, and account `@anicca.jp`. Readback is `not running`, `runs=0`, `never exited`; durable jobs/receipts stayed `84/24`, proving no arm-time publication or Telegram effect. Manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:c294e4e13f2c54a914f4a9ac2c52521d34630b3772225df2fe2d4d0a406f8008` arms exactly Honne EN, Honne JA, and Anicca main TikTok at limit 3; Instagram/JP4/HE remain off, all 22 holds remain, and all three YouTube rows remain 0/day. Runtime uses only LM object refs and LM env; direct success still requires a caption-matching `@anicca.jp` URL before natural Telegram |
| MKT-11-AJIG1 | Capture a repeatable complete Instagram metric source before any Instagram cadence change | Anicca main Instagram `@anicca.jp1` only | **done —** direct Reel `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcTFx_UjSio/` was re-read and bound to native owner `anicca.ios.jp`, exact caption `強い人の口癖、5つだけ`, Postiz integration `cmn8ycvtn02djqx0ytuisn9mw`, and row `cmt2sfjcx02bapj0ymsu4tapf`. Immutable 24h snapshot `object://sha256/e43de2bf938b617e8f0515cbdbaa786252add9b614c13c92b35534662c1f7bd7` records Views `32`, Reach `31`, Saves/Likes/Comments/Shares `0`, derived engagement `0%`; Impressions/Watch time/Average watch time/Completion and account totals remain unavailable with reasons. Replay returned `created=false`, wrong owner failed closed, file mode is `0600`, focused check passes 1/1, and Instagram remains off |
| MKT-11-AJIG2 | Deliver every Instagram observation as natural-language Telegram from the same immutable snapshot | Anicca main Instagram `@anicca.jp1` only | **done —** the existing durable `marketing.liveness.telegram` job now accepts a fail-closed `observed` metric payload and renders every measured value plus all unavailable names, direct Reel URL, window, and immutable object ref. Identity is content-addressed, so the same snapshot builds the same job/effect key. The Instagram collector imports a newly created snapshot into LM object storage, enqueues/claims/completes that message through the local durable ledger, and skips Telegram entirely on snapshot replay. Focused checks pass 7/7; real 24h replay returned `telegram.created=false/reason=snapshot_replay` with jobs/receipts unchanged at `84/24`. The already-sent 24h natural report remains the historical first delivery; it was not duplicated |
| MKT-11-AJIG3 | Schedule all four observation windows and natural Telegram delivery from verified publication time | Anicca main Instagram `@anicca.jp1` only | **done —** LM-owned `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-instagram-metrics` runs the due planner every 1,800 seconds. Each 2h/24h/72h/7d snapshot and Telegram effect is content/window deduped; values resolve from the immutable LM object at execution. A window over 90 minutes late becomes all-unavailable `source_delayed`, never current values mislabeled as historical. Real loop E2E created 2h object `object://sha256/99252a1f3563c6418775fb3e35879e58b284e23235ca1930f87de6d9cdb8880c` and natural Telegram `message_id=28561`; immediate replay added zero jobs/receipts. 24h is complete; 72h is due `2026-08-24T10:10:15.268Z`, 7d `2026-08-28T10:10:15.268Z`. Launchd readback is `not running`, `runs=0`, `never exited`, interval 1800; bootstrap changed no jobs/receipts (`87/25`). Focused checks pass 8/8; Instagram posting remains off |
| MKT-11-AJIG4 | Send one daily natural-language digest from the latest immutable snapshots | Anicca main Instagram `@anicca.jp1` only | **done —** the existing 30-minute LM loop has a `17:30 JST` daily gate. Its first run after the gate selected the latest measured immutable snapshot, preserved every measured/unavailable field, appended `2h unavailable / 24h measured / 72h pending / 7d pending`, and imported daily object `object://sha256/a46a0e56fd03839c9531aeba910937bcf9c62e5540729418c5d50305c914c73d`. The loop itself sent natural Telegram `message_id=28565` with Views `32`, Reach `31`, Likes/Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, Engagement `0%`, and explicit unavailable Impressions/Watch time/Average watch time/Completion/account totals. Immediate same-day replay returned `snapshot_replay`, adding zero jobs/receipts (`90/26` stayed unchanged). Focused checks pass 8/8; no manual composition and Instagram remains off |
| MKT-11-AJIG5 | Discover every future verified publication on the same Instagram account before cadence arm | Anicca main Instagram `@anicca.jp1` only | **done —** the armed 30-minute metric loop now reads the LM-owned `anicca-ios` distribution ledger and accepts only `published + provider_reconciled=true` Instagram rows with direct `/reel/<shortcode>/`, exact `reelclaw-card/nudge-card/ja`, a valid provider row, and a caption object whose bytes match its recorded SHA-256. Each accepted row derives its own shortcode, caption, provider row, and publication time; all persistence/collection/daily paths are parameterized by that verified identity. Focused checks pass 9/9, including discovery of a new valid row; real current-lane replay discovered `DcTFx_UjSio`, kept 72h/7d pending, returned daily `snapshot_replay`, and changed no jobs/receipts (`90/26`) |
| MKT-11-AJIG6 | Enable only the healthy Anicca main Instagram destination | Anicca main Instagram `@anicca.jp1` only | **done —** LM-owned `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-anicca-main-instagram` has one `19:10 JST` slot and is fixed to `anicca-ios/reelclaw-card/ja`, Postiz integration `cmn8ycvtn02djqx0ytuisn9mw`, and profile alias `@anicca.jp1`. It uses only LM env/object refs and the Postiz integration path, with no Instagram credential/profile files. A provider success must reconcile the exact caption to a direct Reel before natural Telegram. Bootstrap readback was `not running`, `runs=0`, `never exited`; jobs/receipts stayed `90/26`, proving no arm-time effect. Manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:a0e95d6574dcbfb6e4f43a941fa8549212101498d1cb6fc6191244e26d4e56fd` arms exactly Honne EN/JA TikTok, Anicca main TikTok, and Anicca main Instagram at their limits; JP4/HE remain off, 22 holds and three YouTube 0/day rows remain. Focused checks pass 20/20; the first scheduled Reel remains subject to direct content/account/Telegram/metrics readback |
| MKT-11-JP4M1 | Capture the complete native and Postiz metric surface before JP4 cadence change | Anicca JP4 TikTok `@anicca.jp4` only | **done as an early 18.37h observation; 24h gate remains open —** native embedded JSON matched direct video `7676495865816632583`, account `@anicca.jp4`, and exact caption `今すぐやれ / 完璧より完了。`; Postiz identity is integration `cmn8x8hdv028uqx0y4gdfse5t` and row `cmt328uot00s2qk0y23e8ptii`. Early immutable object `object://sha256/48e6ea8d1e10865957db5f01e9542e1ec089feec995a99ddfa29693f17b1c55f` measured post Views `141`, Likes `2`, Comments/Shares `0`, Saves `1`, engagement `2.13%`; account Followers `122`, Following `0`, Total Likes `6,839`, Videos `304`, latest-20 Views `11,873`, Likes `110`, Comments `1`, Shares `2`; Reach/Watch time/Completion unavailable. Its original incorrectly labelled `24h` file is preserved mode-`0600` under `quarantine/18h-early-observation.original.json`, while the active 24h slot is empty for the ledger-derived true due time `2026-08-22T14:46:13.230Z`. Wrong caption failed closed, jobs/receipts stayed `90/26`, and JP4 remains off |
| MKT-11-JP4M2 | Deliver every JP4 observation and daily digest from the loop in natural language | Anicca JP4 TikTok `@anicca.jp4` only | **done —** the JP4-only due planner discovers only caption-object-verified direct `@anicca.jp4` publications, schedules 2h/24h/72h/7d plus a 17:30 JST daily digest, preserves a missed window as `source_delayed`, and routes immutable snapshots through the durable natural Telegram renderer. TikTok messages enumerate all post values plus Followers/Following/Total Likes/Videos/latest-20 Views/Likes/Comments/Shares instead of collapsing them to a count. Real loop E2E sent the late 2h all-unavailable report as Telegram `28585` and daily window summary as `28586`; immutable objects are `object://sha256/b19728f95f7f21cc73946cbc8378358812617e52c0215d2c740e0deafd7261da` and `object://sha256/64e23aeb08013626b5c823122e530e49f07f9d427936e67db58d8ca093d503be`. Immediate replay added zero jobs/receipts (`96/28` unchanged). LM-owned label `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-tiktok-metrics` read back `not running`, `runs=0`, `never exited`, interval 1,800 seconds; bootstrap added no effect. Focused tests pass 11/11; JP4 stays off |
| MKT-11-JP4M3 | Verify the true 24h observation produced by the durable loop before cadence eligibility | Anicca JP4 TikTok `@anicca.jp4` only | **done —** Playwright's browser-level CDP connection repeatedly timed out before any snapshot/effect. The collector now reuses the repo's raw CDP client with an explicit isolated target ID, navigates only its owned tab, and closes that exact target. Real loop `runs=18/exit=0` matched caption object SHA `999081b7…4160` (`今すぐやれ / 完璧より完了。`) to direct URL `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp4/video/7676495865816632583`. Immutable 24h snapshot `object://sha256/0f6face148d8a7384ffdcf6fbcc5e37ca63bf4b79f4a7efb70cabbb09da708fe` records Views `151`, Likes `2`, Comments/Shares `0`, Saves `1`, Engagement `1.99%`, all eight account metrics, and explicit unavailable Reach/Watch time/Completion plus Postiz post `empty_response`. Natural Telegram is `29056`; corrected daily is `29057`. Immediate replay `runs=19/exit=0` kept jobs/receipts at `192/60`; focused checks pass 31/31 |
| MKT-11-JP4M4 | Enable only the healthy JP4 destination at its TikTok limit | Anicca JP4 TikTok `@anicca.jp4` only | **done —** manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:747f78c4f944c8c41280d9494b99969e12d79fc7543ef3e9746779ec46e331c1` arms JP4 at `target_daily_limit=3` while HE remains default-off and all 22 holds remain 0/day. New LM-owned label `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-anicca-jp4` has only `09:15/15:15/20:45 JST`, uses explicit JP4 integration/standing approval plus LM object refs, and has no RunAtLoad. Bootstrap readback is `not running`, `runs=0`, `never exited`; jobs/receipts stayed `192/60`, proving arm-time publication and Telegram effects were zero. No legacy label operation |
| MKT-11-HEM1 | Capture and deliver the exact existing HE effect's complete 24h metric source | Anicca HE TikTok `@anicca.he` only | **done —** the recovered effect was absent from distribution JSONL because reconciliation happened after the original provider effect, so discovery uses only exact completed publication job `marketing-video-publication:7732e4…39dd`; it requires the durable receipt's provider-reconciled URL, provider row, format/form/locale, and caption object SHA. The first loop sent late 2h unavailable as Telegram `29071`, never zero. At the exact true-24h gate, `runs=21/exit=0` matched direct URL `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.he/video/7676500512308481296` and caption SHA `999081b7…4160`, then persisted immutable snapshot `object://sha256/b904efb047027c9753903365f5d0fa8320030f5542c74d40c924f8099e7fa34d`: Views `125`, Likes/Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, Engagement `0%`, all eight account metrics, explicit unavailable Reach/Watch time/Completion and Postiz post `empty_response`. Natural Telegram is `29074`. Immediate replay `runs=22/exit=0` kept jobs/receipts at `198/62`; focused checks pass 14/14. No publication effect and HE remains off |
| MKT-11-HEM2 | Enable only the healthy HE destination at its TikTok limit | Anicca HE TikTok `@anicca.he` only | **done —** manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:49f5e55d95caacb8784c8cd579e306e327fa862a7b24739e0993b3748070f7df` arms HE at max 3/day while retaining the five previously armed rows and all 22 holds at 0/day. New LM-owned label `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-anicca-he` has only `07:15/13:45/18:15 JST`, no RunAtLoad, and reads explicit HE integration/standing approval plus existing LM card-pack refs. Bootstrap readback is `not running`, `runs=0`, `never exited`; jobs/receipts stayed `198/62`, proving arm-time publication and Telegram effects zero. Focused checks pass 21/21; no legacy operation |
| MKT-11 | Collect complete TikTok/Instagram metrics for Honne and Anicca at 2h/24h/72h/7d, then join App Store Connect, RevenueCat, and product analytics by creative lineage | every published non-YouTube account | **in progress one account at a time —** Honne EN/JA and Anicca main TikTok have 24h observations and are armed at 3/day; Anicca main Instagram is armed at 1/day. JP4 now has a repeatable true-24h source and is eligible for its isolated arm; HE remains off and follows JP4. Every source attempts the complete social/account surface and preserves unavailable explicitly. ASC, RevenueCat, and product analytics must join by creative/campaign lineage in MKT-11B before growth or revenue is attributed. YouTube remains 0/day by owner instruction |
| MKT-11P1 | Reconcile the health of every already-armed publication schedule before claiming daily cadence | Honne EN/JA TikTok and Anicca main TikTok/Instagram only | **done —** Honne EN is terminal at direct URL `7676388327427149077`, Telegram `27358`, replay 0. Honne JA is terminal at direct URL `7676832422364728584`, Telegram `28920`, replay 0. Anicca main TikTok's corrected latest direct URL is `https://www.tiktok.com/@anicca.jp/video/7676852644698262791`, corrected Telegram `28959`, replay 0; the stale duplicate-caption URL and Telegram `28951` remain quarantined. Anicca main Instagram kickstart resolves Postiz row `cmt47w3970bzgqk0y8biiy3oj` and exact caption `強さは静けさから生まれる` to direct Reel `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DcVqoxWjyNK/`; native page readback identifies owner `anicca.ios.jp` and the exact caption/hashtags. Final replay reads `runs=2/exit=0`, jobs/receipts stay `177/55`, generation/publication/Telegram are all `created=false`, and the retained natural receipt is Telegram `28657`. All four already-armed schedules are healthy; no cadence expansion and no JP4/HE/YouTube enablement |
| MKT-11A | Emit natural-language Telegram for every 2h/24h/72h/7d observation plus daily and weekly tiers from the same immutable snapshot used by the panel | every measured non-YouTube product/account/platform | **done for current daily/weekly tiers; future windows continue under durable owners —** per-post receipts use the Rockstar_ibot natural-language renderer and reject the raw legacy shape. Honne and Anicca daily summaries plus the weekly review are immutable, source-labelled, and replay-deduped. Every metric message preserves measured values and explicitly unavailable fields; future 72h/7d observations remain scheduled |
| MKT-11A1 | Connect one already-armed TikTok account to automatic window and daily natural-language reporting | Honne EN TikTok `@honne_reveal` only | **done; future windows time-gated under durable owner —** the existing TikTok due collector accepts only `honne-ai/reelclaw/relationship-confession/en/@honne_reveal`, excluding the older generic `relationship-intent` row, and verifies caption-object SHA plus direct URL. Real loop E2E sent the late 2h all-unavailable observation as Telegram `28603` (`object://sha256/99505bd2dbaa44e7ab4fbc6a0f0db9cca302fe0015f401fec389754bd24fc3d8`) and daily summary as `28604` (`object://sha256/73c7f13a8c6151bdd22c026fd5d38cb3baad4a3e3aefddf5d9819b00c583b65a`); immediate replay added zero jobs/receipts (`102/30` unchanged). 24h is due `2026-08-22T09:48:55.372Z`; 72h/7d remain pending under the same 30-minute loop. Focused checks pass 12/12; no cadence change |
| MKT-11A2 | Repeat the proven automatic reporting path for the next armed TikTok account | Honne JA TikTok `@honnevideo` only | **done —** the target-gated planner accepts exact `honne-ai/reelclaw/relationship-confession/ja/@honnevideo`, with EN/JA account and locale isolation proven. Real loop E2E sent late 2h Telegram `28607` (`object://sha256/bbf3c49c8fce986a1eb67f9269b6c63ebc3f62400383c41d6cd749bc32b180c8`), daily `28608` (`object://sha256/541d5f32248acd0ee73386c0e80377aac8b2770a374279b3283f23b283aca598`), and reconciled the pre-existing measured 24h snapshot exactly once as `28611` (`object://sha256/72e1665d65656a2071174ed6caa882c3834c13de5e0fc32d4195ca601eb7551d`). The 24h message enumerates Views `1,035`, Likes `11`, Comments/Shares/Saves `0`, Engagement `1.06%`, all eight account metrics, and unavailable Reach/Watch time/Completion. Immediate replay added zero jobs/receipts (`111/33` unchanged); 72h/7d remain time-gated; focused checks pass 12/12; no cadence change |
| MKT-11A3 | Repeat the proven automatic reporting path for Anicca main TikTok | Anicca main TikTok `@anicca.jp` only | **done —** exact `anicca-ios/reelclaw-card/nudge-card/ja/@anicca.jp` target is isolated from JP4/Honne. Real loop sent late 2h `28614` (`object://sha256/f81fedf10767c946bc8d17308d7782b69cae25856393c5a3307633ce1978691c`), measured 24h `28615` (`object://sha256/631074806072b8939a77051189ca70b7122fe4d8e604de8b2169fcdd3a4a248b`), and daily `28616`. E2E exposed that daily selection incorrectly trusted Postiz post status over measured native metrics; the root fix now chooses measured/derived snapshot fields, preserves the original report, and sent explicit daily corrections `28620` for Anicca and `28621` for Honne JA. Corrected Anicca daily object `object://sha256/9f3b2491ba1fd4811805780b3b6147751b2abc4d3f17c85ec6c582035c4b6066` contains Views `108`, all eight account metrics, and `24h measured`; corrected Honne JA object is `object://sha256/dc01889a3ea8607fdf95c95ac1c816eefcfdcc62e2866d8ea8b17071944c983a`. Immediate replay added zero jobs/receipts (`126/38` unchanged); focused checks pass 14/14; no cadence change or cross-product weights |
| MKT-11A4 | Emit product daily summaries and one weekly Honne-vs-Anicca review | all verified non-YouTube lanes | split into MKT-11A4H → MKT-11A4A → MKT-11A4W so only one product/effect is active at once |
| MKT-11A4H | Emit one Honne daily product summary | Honne EN/JA TikTok only | **done —** the LM-owned 30-minute TikTok metrics loop produced immutable summary `object://sha256/c1224a206e50a813a2115d37b7192dbaabe78140192c58d9931b32986f15f072` and natural Telegram `28973`. It contains both caption-matched direct URLs, Views/Likes/Comments/Shares/Saves/Engagement and account metrics; Installs/Trials/Paid are explicitly `取得不可`, never zero. After restoring the already-declared lockfile dependency tree, the exact launchd label completed at `runs=10/exit=0`. Immediate kickstart replay completed at `runs=11/exit=0`, returned `summary_replay`, and kept jobs/receipts at `180/56` |
| MKT-11A4A | Emit one Anicca daily product summary | Anicca main TikTok/Instagram plus explicit JP4/HE source status | **done —** the existing LM-owned TikTok metrics loop now invokes the product-generic builder and durable sender after Honne replay. Real run `runs=12/exit=0` sent natural Telegram `28983` from immutable summary `object://sha256/09861d40f28e7f16d591ea3d9abe82bfd3f5b877c0fcd22ff37901ff2c4e69d9`. Main TikTok/Instagram rows include direct URLs and measured/unavailable fields; JP4's delayed daily source remains explicit unavailable, HE remains daily-source unavailable with only its verified direct URL, and Installs/Trials/Paid remain `取得不可`. Immediate replay at `runs=13/exit=0` returned `summary_replay` for both products and kept jobs/receipts at `183/57`; focused checks pass 13/13 |
| MKT-11A4W | Emit one weekly Honne-vs-Anicca review | completed product daily summaries | **done —** the LM-owned metrics loop produced immutable weekly review `object://sha256/dcfb358df647d477106091a26897279b047c45f6f0887453dd6ebed46acf1e22` and natural Telegram `29050`. It binds Honne daily `c1224a…f072` and Anicca daily `09861d…e69d9`, reports honest `1/7` coverage, preserves each account's measured/unavailable values and direct URL, marks ASC/RevenueCat/product attribution unavailable, and explicitly refuses a cross-product winner or weight transfer. The weekly job completed with `unknown_effect=false`; immediate same-label replay kept jobs/receipts at `186/58`. Focused checks pass 14/14. A later JP4 browser timeout leaves the overall label at exit 1 but does not alter the terminal weekly receipt |
| MKT-11B | Compute attribution coverage and separate verified platform-attributed installs from partial/unattributed installs; include YouTube only for Anicca | every product and campaign | each report shows campaign ID, observation window, source status, and confidence; timing alone never becomes causal attribution |
| MKT-11B1 | Preserve creative, hook, publication, account, and campaign lineage in one attribution input | Honne and Anicca independently | **done —** the LM-owned one-shot lineage builder resolved all six selected 24h social snapshots to exactly one publication receipt using product, locale, platform, provider post ID, and caption-matching direct URL. It integrity-read the exact video/caption objects, preserved creative, first-line hook + hash, slot, publication time, account/integration, window, and immutable metric ref in `object://sha256/592db55a119c08aaa6ec3269002be6c53371f8097b27a140dd040e2567174df1`. No campaign link exists, so all six rows remain `campaign_status=unavailable` and `attribution_status=unattributed`; attribution rate is unavailable, not zero. Immediate replay returned `created=false` with the same object ref. No ASC/RevenueCat value, publication, Telegram effect, or cadence change |
| MKT-11B2 | Join App Store Connect acquisition observations without inventing creative attribution | Honne and Anicca independently | **done —** App inventory readback bound Anicca `6755129214` and Honne `6759667221` to separate API requests. Anicca's official App Downloads Standard and Discovery/Engagement Detailed segments for data `2026-08-19..21` produced First-time downloads `1`, Updates `1`, Total downloads `1`, Impressions `9`, Unique impressions `5`, Product page views `0`, and Unique product page views `0`; product totals remain `unattributed` with confidence `official_product_total_no_campaign` and are never copied to one of the four Anicca social rows. Honne had only a stale one-time snapshot, so ongoing request `c7c05836-181e-49cc-ae71-b57b7a0b466e` was created; its first report remains `unavailable/report_pending`, never zero. Immutable joined snapshot `object://sha256/a583c9d48c955941d3af54d1a52f4804018fe7bcbfb30af7466ecac13dd92e6b` binds B1 lineage `592db5…4df1`; all six social rows remain unattributed. Same-day replay returned `created=false`. The existing LM-owned 30-minute TikTok metrics loop collects ASC once after 22:00 JST; readback was runs `23`, last exit `0`. API timeout/empty data fails product-local to unavailable. The initial UTC/empty-parser zero snapshot is quarantined and not consumed |
| MKT-11B3 | Join RevenueCat trial, subscription, renewal, cancellation, and proceeds observations | Honne and Anicca independently | **done —** Rockstar_ibot does not administer RevenueCat or read another runtime's path/env. It accepts only a schema-checked product-owned observation from its product-pack inbox, rejects product identity mixing and any unavailable metric represented as zero, and imports it after the exact ASC snapshot. No valid RevenueCat API credential or product export was available without a new login, so Anicca and Honne independently remain `unavailable/product_pack_observation_missing` for trials, active subscriptions, renewals, cancellations, and proceeds; every value is `null`, never zero. Immutable snapshot `object://sha256/46769d5e1ae5f980bf24b342316fbf70f9cc7aab9254851f17efc601f9cacbc4` binds ASC `a583c9…92e6b`, forbids timing-only attribution, and labels RevenueCat proceeds as an estimate rather than store settlement. Immediate replay returned `created=false`. The existing LM-owned 22:00 metrics path now imports this product-pack observation after ASC; focused checks pass 4/4 |
| MKT-11B4 | Join product activation/retention and publish attribution coverage | Honne and Anicca independently | **done —** the existing summary renderer now joins the exact ASC and RevenueCat immutable inputs with a schema-checked product-owned activation/retention inbox. Missing product observations remain `null/unavailable`; a measured source cannot contain unavailable fields, product identity mixing fails closed, and D1/D7 retention is accepted only as an explicit cohort observation. Daily coverage `object://sha256/e03e723f04ba94b9ac57954856b7fcbe7be037ff650a1d8bf7f715276dad74e3` reports Anicca official Install `1`, with activation/trial/paid/retained/D1/D7/proceeds unavailable; Honne remains unavailable including pending ASC. Campaign attribution rate remains unavailable rather than zero. Natural Telegram `29142` was sent through the LM summary receipt path; immediate replay returned `summary_replay`. The 22:00 LM metrics path now runs ASC → RevenueCat → product coverage → natural Telegram → weekly review; future product daily/weekly summaries consume the same coverage. Focused checks pass 8/8 |
| MKT-12A0 | Establish one campaign-linked cohort before changing a hook | Honne EN only | **reopened and blocked by MKT-09 recovery —** `honne_en_base_20260823` was shared by eleven changing hooks, so it is not a one-hook baseline cohort. Rebuild it only after recovery with one immutable campaign token per baseline/challenger, then require direct-native publication, natural Telegram, replay 0, social metrics, and official product readback before changing the hook |
| MKT-12 | Run bounded learning: change one hook/format/CTA variable, keep or revert from receipts, and prove the next run consumed the decision | Honne and Anicca separately | one-variable challenger, keep/revert receipt, and next-run consumption receipt |
| MKT-12A | Run the first one-variable hook challenger from a usable attributed cohort | Honne EN only | freeze format/CTA/asset family; change one hook; compare source-labelled cohort; keep or revert; next generated publication proves it consumed the decision |
| MKT-12B | Repeat bounded hook learning without cross-product leakage | Honne JA only | same gate as MKT-12A with independent locale/account weights |
| MKT-12C | Repeat bounded hook learning without cross-product leakage | Anicca iOS only | same gate as MKT-12A with independent Anicca weights; no Honne winner is copied without a new Anicca challenger |
| MKT-13 | Retire legacy ownership only after every retained platform lane passes its canary/metrics/replay gate | entire mobile fleet | Rockstar_ibot is sole owner; Postiz remains the selected provider; old disabled state remains archived rollback evidence |

### 12.3 Atomic finish checklist

This checklist is the implementation order from the current state to the end of
the incident recovery. Complete exactly one row at a time. A `PUBLISHED`
provider row, a numeric `releaseId`, an enabled integration, or an HTTP 200
profile page is never enough by itself.

`Time-gated pending` observations are monitored state, not executable work: their
durable LM loop continues while exactly one later non-dependent row is active.
Their dependent account arm remains blocked until the observation is terminal.

Native profile `アニッチャ` and its Japanese affirmation/App Store bio match the product and locale; live Postiz is `instagram-standalone`, disabled=false. The adopted disabled cron command passes this ID only as `--ig`; a separate cron that incorrectly passes the Instagram ID as `--tt`, plus legacy `|| true` and IG-failure omission, are explicitly rejected.

Direct visual audit confirms the fixed Japanese hook plus five Japanese body slides with no blank, clipped, or foreign frame. Body source `7467383752117718303` was selected after rejecting repeated timestamp-less source `7197571464126549291`; `include_cta=false` proves six, not seven, slides. Read-only adversarial verification returned `ship`. Manifest `marketing-lane-manifest:cef325cc72d308910dde59ee5f351c9b85b4952b1f5da1c7ce75c9a5f56ab06d` records `pack-ready`, default-off, target 1/day, armed 0; fence remains closed. The one-time legacy renderer supplied migration input only: LM runtime has no OpenClaw path/env/assets dependency, and provider/history/legacy-job writes are 0 | execute a legacy publisher, add a CTA slide, reuse the repeatedly selected source, or retain a runtime OpenClaw dependency |
| 22A | **done — MKT-09R8-03A:** implement the dedicated native-carousel publication contract under TDD; provider writes remain 0 | Order 21 passes | the pinned `marketing:carousel` effect binds `anicca-ios` / JA / Larry / `@ani.cca1234` / exact integration / pack SHA / ordered six-media digest / caption SHA and still uses capability `marketing.video.publish`, so the existing fence and lane policy remain authoritative. Pack, every JPEG, caption, and dedicated approval are SHA-verified before the token or transport is reached. Postiz receives only the raw integration ID and one ordered `post_type=post` image array; the full integration ref stays in approval/receipt. Carousel receipts require reconciled direct Instagram `/p/<shortcode>` and reject profile, Reel, and numeric-release-only URLs. Provider error/result mismatch is `unknown_effect`; response loss, missing/malformed/unmatched local JSONL all reconcile `unknown`, never `absent`, so no retry is authorized without provider proof. Carousel caption preserves the exact approved UTF-8 bytes while legacy video trim behavior is unchanged. TDD RED captured missing adapter and unsupported payload; GREEN passes new Node 9/9, combined Node 47/47, Postiz plus distribution Python 55/55, `py_compile`, and diff-check. Fresh adversarial review found and the implementation fixed the response-loss duplicate risk plus caption-byte mismatch; no provider/runtime/legacy write occurred | infer absence from a missing local row, trim approved carousel copy, pass an integration URI to Postiz, or reuse the generic video receipt |
| 22B | **done — MKT-09R8-03B:** run one canary for only that account | Order 22A passes | exact effect `marketing:carousel:anicca-ios:LARRY-JA-CANARY:…` completed once as Postiz row `cmt91js0200afmp0yll86hhqj` at direct `https://www.instagram.com/p/DceW-whAQT7/`. Public captioned embed binds owner `ani.cca1234` and the exact Japanese caption; its GraphSidecar has six ordered native JPEGs and every slide is pixel-identical to its ordered LM object (RMSE `0`).

The outer tool stream ended after the provider effect but before its wrapper restored temporary controls; the exact Postiz row was read back without retry, then fence and manifest were restored before verification.

Direct `https://www.instagram.com/reel/DbInY17DSpI/` binds owner `anicca.en` to the exact English widget caption. Postiz has 392 historical rows for this integration, with recent direct Reel rows dominated by Widget EN; Card EN remains isolated on `@anicca.encards`, so old card/widget mixing is not adopted. `@aniccaen2` remains held because native availability is unproved and recent Postiz rows are 0; unavailable `@anicca.affirmation` remains held; live `@anicca.bochi` remains held because its 233-row history mixes the AI memorial/tomb product with mental-health content.

Corrected classification `5728925f…7c5c6c` binds only `anicca-ios` / JA / Instagram / `reelclaw-card` / `nudge-card-reel` / existing pack `694e3ab6…7d480`, and its caption is byte-identical to `bdef736e…601d9` including final LF; superseded `48fc8782…e2e34` is retained. The other four recent rows are classified only as direct Reels with Japanese Anicca/self-care captions, not visually asserted as Card.

Current native transcode/contact sheet `ae07770e…b5640` / `cd167041…a38fc` are classification-only because strict SSIM min is `0.921209`; no terminal comparator claim is made. Existing stronger manifest state is preserved byte-for-byte; provider/Telegram/scheduler/legacy writes 0 | classify Larry EN or several accounts in parallel, infer product from a handle, or treat visual classification as terminal native verification |

Exact LF-terminated caption `311f9c3d…6ba2eb`, account-bound pack `76937db0…fe311c`, visual `6ddf6284…9149dc`, and four-candidate evidence `e0a7b1ab…eeb06f` are SHA-exact/mode `0600`. Historical `DcTFx_UjSio` uses this media but the wrong `強い人の口癖…` caption, so it is not an exact-content success. Manifest `bbc2bb24…ca124` truthfully moves only this lane to pack-ready; actual 0/day/default-off/armed 0 and fence closed. The pack operation itself changes no jobs/receipts at `771/250`; a later unrelated Honne effect-class-none generation moves the global count to `774/251` without provider/message effect. Fresh adversary returned `SHIP` | reuse mismatched metadata/caption, accept media 1/2, call the prior canary exact-content success, duplicate video bytes, or change the shared TikTok/Instagram pack env |

Caption/pack ledger refs are each 0; the reusable selected-video ref appears in jobs/receipts `125/11`, but the joint integration+caption+pack+video identity is 0. Superseded `79dd1fc4…a0b32b8` is retained after adversarial review caught its manually transcribed non-pack video hash. Global jobs/receipts remain `774/251`; manifest remains pack-ready/default-off/armed 0 and fence closed; provider/Telegram/scheduler/legacy writes are 0 | post again before proving absence, accept caption-only/profile/provider state, or reuse the mismatched `DcTFx_UjSio` receipt |

The 2h observation remains asynchronously due and does not block the next cadence item. Dirty canonical user edits and every legacy label remain untouched | wait idly for a metric window, classify non-selected accounts, retry either effect, mass-enable, or claim armed 0 is daily posting |
| 25 | **in progress — MKT-10:** arm only one healthy verified account at a time, ramping its first, second, then third daily slot | exact account has correct-content publication, Telegram, replay, and usable metric-source evidence | eight exact routes are production-armed at 3/day: Honne EN/JA TikTok, Anicca main TikTok/Instagram, JP4 TikTok, HE TikTok, EN Card Instagram, and EN Widget Instagram `@anicca.en`. The EN Widget owner runs at 07:30/09:30/19:00 JST from three SHA-fixed, visually inspected Widget videos; Postiz row `cmt9s1bhb0157qs0ycftl5z21` is API `PUBLISHED` on exact integration `cmn8y95rg02d2qx0y09bbk5pb` with caption `Turn screen time into / self-belief`, direct Reel `Dcfr0uzjigz`, natural Telegram `35224`, and generation/publication/message replay all `created=false`. Existing 30-minute LM metrics owner exits 0 and registers exact 2h `2026-08-26T09:33:56.573Z`, 24h, 72h, 7d, and daily windows as pending; old canary delay remains `source_delayed`, never zero. Manifest `6ea71d6a…e1c3b2` has armed 8 and holds 17. Next is only JA Widget Instagram `@anicca.jp.videos`; every later route remains default-off | jump directly to three/day everywhere, reuse a visibly broken candidate, or leave a healthy selected destination below three/day |
| 26 | **MKT-11:** collect 2h/24h/72h/7d social metrics and join ASC, RevenueCat, and product analytics | exact published effect has immutable creative/campaign lineage | views, likes, comments, shares, saves, watch/retention fields when supported, installs, activation, trials, paid, proceeds, and attribution coverage are source-labelled; unavailable stays unavailable | substitute account aggregates for post outcomes or infer installs from timing |
| 27 | **MKT-12:** close bounded hook learning independently for Honne EN, Honne JA, and Anicca | one product/account has a usable attributed cohort | stable assignment; one hook token per baseline/challenger; immutable outcome; keep/revert CAS decision; next generation proves it consumed the decision | LRU rotation, shared campaign token, cross-product winner, or multi-variable edit |
| 28 | **MKT-13:** finish daily/weekly natural Telegram reporting, then retire legacy ownership | every retained route has Orders 16–27 evidence | reports cover every retained lane and funnel source with replay dedupe; LM is sole owner; legacy disabled state stays archived rollback evidence | raw integration/profile receipts, hidden unavailable data, or deleting legacy evidence |

The product-growth sequence after incident recovery remains: (1) close and prove
marketing, (2) use App Store Connect, RevenueCat, Mixpanel/PostHog, reviews, and
retention evidence to iterate the existing apps, then (3) generalize build,
submission, rejection-repair, and release into the mobile-app development loop.
`$10k MRR` is the first outcome target, not a guaranteed system property; higher
portfolio targets require measured unit economics, platform-policy compliance,
and independent product demand.

| Now | Work | Why it is still missing | Done evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Repair and freeze the machine-readable scheduler inventory | the OpenClaw store and live scheduler disagree, and launchd is the real owner of many loops | every stored and loaded job has one `migrate`, `replace`, or `retire` decision and an owner; measured: all 399 captured rows and all 269 enabled-or-loaded rows now have exactly one disposition and a non-null owner |
| 2 | Decide every legacy job and freeze new legacy writes | inventory without disposition cannot drive a safe cutover | each job has a Rockstar_ibot owner, target adapter, effect class, verification command, and rollback action; measured: 214 migrate, 40 replace, 132 retire, and 13 retain-external rows are recorded with rollback actions, and verification commands are set only for the five adapters that already exist |
| 3 | Build the portable local runtime foundation | current loops lack one shared Rockstar_ibot data root, secret provider, durable generic job protocol, and local direct-process bundle. A legacy-path dependency scan now exists and passes (`apps/rockstar_ibot/scripts/scan-legacy-paths.js` + `scan-legacy-paths.test.js`, wired into `npm test` as `test:legacy-paths`): it walks the monorepo runtime (`apps/rockstar_ibot`, `runtime/`) plus every skill the runtime actually loads or spawns — `skills/video/daily-lm-video`, `skills/video/lm-distribution`, `skills/tools/telegram-user`, `skills/rockstar_ibot`, and `skills/earn/marketing-engine` (whose `run_agent.sh` is spawned by `rockstar_ibot-daily.sh` and `rockstar_ibot-dev-d0.sh`) — and fails on any non-allowlisted `.openclaw`/`profitable-claude`/`life-manager-v0` reference or legacy anicca code-root reference (`$HOME`-, `${HOME}`-, or `~`-rooted anicca checkout and the anicca-oss checkout). The allowlist holds only (a) line-pinned denial regexes and copy-only migration tooling and (b) an explicitly tracked, line-and-content-pinned set of five pre-Order-12 holes: the x402-sell/taskmarket/payout earn-loop boot defaults that still point at the legacy anicca code roots, each named with its owning Order (Order 12); `verifyAllowlist` fails the scan the moment any pinned line moves, changes, or disappears. The runtime's own legacy-path dependencies in that scope were removed: `daily-dev-loop.js` defaults its state dir to `<data root>/state/rockstar_ibot-dev` via `resolveDataRoot` in `runtime-paths.js` (`LM_DATA_DIR`, falling back to `~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot`), the four launchd boot scripts (payout, x402 ledger, taskmarket ledger, ugig observer) load `LIFE_MANAGER_ENV_FILE` (default `~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/.env`) through a shared guarded loader that warns-but-boots when the file is absent and refuses (exit 1) any env file beneath a legacy runtime root, the taskmarket/ugig installers and the dev/taskmarket/ugig launchd templates write logs beneath `~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/logs`, and the daily video generator's argless defaults resolve to the same `<data root>/state/lm-video` paths `rockstar_ibot-daily.sh` exports. Existing on-disk legacy state (lm-video recordings/render state, dev-loop `done.jsonl` dedup history) is migrated copy-based via `apps/rockstar_ibot/scripts/migrate-legacy-state.sh` (idempotent copy with size readback, never move/delete — the legacy loop stays owner until cutover); until that copy has run, `generate.py` and the dev loop fail loudly naming the migration script instead of silently starting empty or silently reading the legacy path. Still OPEN in this row (not claimed): the shared secret vault/provider (Order 6), local append-only ledger/atomic lease implementation, and the legacy-env-inaccessibility proof (cutover gate 6: denied `~/.openclaw` access without interruption); no Order is marked done by this slice | one direct local entrypoint starts the scheduler and workers from the Rockstar_ibot data root while all legacy roots are denied |
| 4 | Finish Telegram command migration and shadow the current financial report | the bounded report adapter is complete, but the rest of bot command routing and seven-run cutover evidence remain | **report slice proven:** local Rockstar_ibot sent real `message_id=432`, stored matching snapshot/effect receipt, and read no OpenClaw env. **Command routing slice done:** the LM webhook's slash-command surface now covers the legacy telegram_bot.py parity list (/help /status /where /stop /subscribe /connect /payout /reset, plus the already-routed /start and /panel and the edited_message live-location stream) via a generic router (`apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/slash-command.js` + `lib/late-notice.js#deleteLiveLocation`) with unit and fake-transport HTTP contract tests (`lib/slash-command.test.js`, `test/telegram-slash-http-contract.test.js`, both wired into `npm test`) proving unknown-/command honesty, branch ordering against the payout intake / feedback / panel / browser-task branches, tenant-scoped /stop deletion, idempotent /payout reopen, and the /connect alias into the existing parsed-control flow. **Adversary follow-ups closed:** (a) /reset now discloses that rewinding `tg_onboard_stage` also pauses browser-task intake (`lib/browser-task-intake.js` accepts only the `"done"` stage) and the coupling is named in code; (b) only an exact `/start` (optionally `@BotName`, optionally followed by a deep-link payload) is a start — `"/startfoo"` is answered as an unknown command, safe because Telegram deep links always deliver the payload space-separated (`core.telegram.org/bots/features` → Deep Linking: `?start=airplane` → `/start airplane`, `?startgroup=spaceship` → `/start@your_bot spaceship`); (c) `/connect <non-calendar>` (e.g. `/connect gmail`) is answered honestly instead of silently connecting Calendar; (d) `/status` distinguishes `active` / `complimentary until <expiry>` / `not active` so a comped row (`lib/comp-window.js`, which already carries it past the paywall) is no longer told its subscription is inactive; the seven-run shadow stays open |
| 5 | Import shared execution contracts needed by retained loops | the shared adapter registry, content-addressed object import, tenant profile boundary, and financial/first marketing adapters are complete; most marketing and income loops still execute through legacy paths | Rockstar_ibot owns the remaining minimum runner, schemas, artifacts, publications, receipts, and verification adapters needed to preserve behavior |
| 6 | Migrate Larry/ReelClaw, Capafy, clipping, writer, gig, bounty, and all retained loops | `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-daily` now has real portable generation and TikTok distribution receipts, a fixed visible-hook render, an idempotent generation→Instagram/TikTok durable-job chain, a read-only verified Rockstar_ibot-owned IG profile, and a generic due-window observation pipeline. Honne JA now also has a generic Rockstar_ibot-owned 24-hook/four-media producer with a completed durable `HJA-007` shadow receipt and idempotent replay. A generic (product-agnostic) marketing video publication adapter now exists at `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/marketing-video-publication-adapter.js`, binding product/format/form/locale/slot/creative to one platform-scoped publish effect and passing its contract tests (job build, Instagram+TikTok+Anicca-YouTube planning, tenant-scoped provider execution with lineage/URL, direct YouTube URL verification, and cross-product/mismatched-provider rejection); its job identity now agrees with its effect identity (job_id is derived from tenant + effect_key, slot is lineage only), so a replay of the same bytes+caption+platform at a new slot can never violate the database's `UNIQUE (tenant_id, effect_key)` rule or double-post. Its reconcile path is now proven by passing tests: `distribute.py` writes format/form/locale/slot lineage into every ledger row, a ledger-recovered receipt passes the adapter's own verification before "present" is returned, `provider_reconciled` is propagated from the ledger row (never fabricated), the absent path returns the reconciler-required receipt shape (`lookup: "ledger_no_published_row"`), and legacy shadow rows without lineage resolve to "unknown" without crashing the reader; the distribution subprocess also runs on an allowlisted environment instead of the full parent env. Reconcile provenance is now propagated on all paths (the ledger short-circuit reports the existing row's `provider_reconciled` instead of fabricating true, and the subprocess allowlist passes the real chain's `INSTAGRAPI_PYTHON`/`CDP_HOST`/`CDP_PORT` through), unknown reconciliation now ages (a durable per-attempt counter dead-letters the job with `RECONCILE_UNKNOWN_EXHAUSTED` after 5 consecutive unknown reconcile results, reset on resolution, per `migrations/20260730_runtime_reconcile_unknown_aging.sql`), and the chain's two-platform fanout is sequential fail-fast (a first-platform enqueue collision stops the remaining platform's enqueue in the same scan), all proven by passing python/node/postgres tests. It is not yet wired into any scheduler or the loop-adapter registry manifest. A generic `marketing-video-publication-chain.js` now chains one generic video generation receipt into exactly two independent durable Instagram/TikTok publication jobs product-generically, with an end-to-end fake-store proof (enqueue→claim→execute→complete, then full replay with 0 new jobs, 0 claimable jobs, 0 additional provider executions, under the enforced `(tenant_id, effect_key)` unique rule) and cross-product/hash-mismatch/different-slot rejection all proven by passing tests; it is not yet wired into any scheduler. Honne JA generic video scheduling is now wired into the Rockstar_ibot scheduler in shadow mode behind `LM_HONNE_JA_SHADOW_ENABLED` (default `false`, enabled nowhere), with slots encoding exactly the legacy 12:30/21:30 Asia/Tokyo launchd cadence (`lib/honne-ja-shadow-schedule.js`); one real manual shadow cycle (`scripts/honne-ja-shadow-cycle.js`) against the running local durable store completed generation receipt hook `HJA-008` (job `marketing-video-generation:0f19ddbb…`, slot `2026-07-30T03:30:00.000Z`, `video_sha256` equal to the legacy source bytes) through the same worker path as the HJA-007 proof, and enqueued both Instagram/TikTok publication jobs durably in a held state (`queued` + durable `shadow_held` hold row, zero provider calls, idempotent replay with no new rows); a seven-cycle status reader (`scripts/honne-ja-shadow-status.js`) counts, per §13 semantics, only the trailing run of consecutive EXPECTED 12:30/21:30 JST slots each holding exactly one verified receipt — an expected slot that passed with no receipt row (scheduler off/stopped) breaks and resets the count and is reported in `missed_slots`, and a duplicate receipt for one slot is a gate violation that also resets — so scattered receipts can never reach `gate_met`; it reports n/7 toward the §13 seven-expected-run gate. Product attribution, bounded learning, the remaining broken Larry/ReelClaw slices, and all other loops remain open; all new fanout stays disabled during shadowing. A 2026-07-30 local compose override once produced a 1/7 status, but on 2026-08-20 no Rockstar_ibot marketing scheduler/worker process or container is running, so the shadow gate is not accruing and no current cutover ownership is claimed | every retained effect executes from a Rockstar_ibot job and produces a machine-verifiable receipt |
| 7 | Switch scheduler ownership and prove OpenClaw-free local | launchd and OpenClaw can still become competing writers | seven expected local cycles pass with the gateway stopped and all legacy roots inaccessible, without missed or duplicate effects |
| 8 | Package the supported local option | a working checkout is not yet a reproducible self-hosted product | clean-machine install, upgrade, backup/restore, health check, and uninstall verification pass |
| 9 | Deploy the same release to cloud | current Railway service does not yet own every retained loop or worker class | API, scheduler, and worker pools run the same contracts and release hashes as local |
| 10 | Add cloud tenant isolation and monthly subscription | hosted operation needs durable entitlement and fair resource isolation | Stripe webhook entitlement, tenant isolation, quotas, cancellation/export, and noisy-neighbor tests pass |
| 11 | Shadow, cut over, and prove Mac-independent cloud | cloud cannot become scheduler owner without parity evidence | reconciled shadow, Dais canary, then seven expected cycles with the Mac Mini powered off and no duplicate effects |
| 12 | Resume product feature work | finance expansion and marketing self-improvement are intentionally frozen during migration | Order 26 is complete; Orders 27–38 become active in sequence |

## 13. Cutover gates

Normal cutover never disables a running legacy job until its replacement
passes. Incident quarantine is the explicit exception: already-disabled jobs
stay disabled and preserved as rollback state while controlled recovery proves
the replacement; they are not mass-enabled merely to satisfy this gate.

1. Seven consecutive expected runs have complete receipts.
2. At least one real publication per selected account is reconciled to a
   platform URL.
3. Financial panel and Telegram share a snapshot hash.
4. Local worker restart does not create duplicate effects.
5. OpenClaw dependency scan is empty for migrated runtime paths.
6. Forced OpenClaw shutdown plus denied access to `~/.openclaw` does not
   interrupt local Rockstar_ibot.
7. Rollback restores the prior scheduler state from a signed inventory.

Cloud becomes Dais's scheduler owner only after:

1. The same release passes local and cloud contract tests.
2. Local and cloud shadow outputs reconcile.
3. One scheduler-owner lease prevents double execution during transfer.
4. Real posting and Telegram delivery succeed from cloud.
5. A powered-off Mac does not interrupt seven expected cloud cycles.

## 14. Security and commercial constraints

| Constraint | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Tenant isolation | every row and job is tenant-scoped; cross-tenant joins fail closed |
| Credentials | encrypted at rest; references only in jobs; redacted in logs and reports |
| Local secrets | OS keychain or encrypted Rockstar_ibot vault; never `.env` files inherited from OpenClaw |
| Cloud secrets | tenant-scoped vault with audited access and rotation |
| Bank access | Moneytree LINK/OAuth; no raw MUFG credentials |
| Apple access | App Store Connect API keys/delegated roles; no stored Apple ID password |
| Financial action | read-only in this spec |
| Publishing | explicit connector authorization and auditable publication receipt |
| Data export/delete | user-controlled export and deletion without deleting financial audit records required by law |
| Claims | no guaranteed income or “automatic $10k MRR” promise |

## 15. Success metrics

| Layer | Metric |
|---|---|
| Independence | retained loops with zero OpenClaw/legacy-path references; unowned scheduler entries |
| Portability | contract suite passing unchanged in local and cloud modes; tenant export/import reconciliation |
| Reliability | expected jobs with valid receipts; duplicate effects; stale sources |
| Variety | unique hook fingerprints; format concentration; duplicate rejection rate |
| Acquisition | per-product/locale/platform/account views, clicks, attributed installs per 1,000 impressions, and attribution coverage |
| Monetization | install→trial, trial→paid, paid retention, MRR, proceeds |
| Reporting | natural-language Telegram receipt/digest/review coverage; snapshot-hash parity; duplicate messages |
| Learning | scorable observations, kept challengers, reverted regressions, consumed weight receipts |
| Finance | reconciled net worth coverage, classified income coverage, source freshness |
| Product | users whose measured monthly benefit/revenue exceeds subscription cost |

## 16. Spec self-review

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Placeholder scan | No unresolved implementation placeholders |
| Internal consistency | The incident path is one direct local process with JSONL/atomic-file ledgers; a hosted adapter is deferred and must not alter the local contract |
| Scope | Program is decomposed into OpenClaw independence and local recovery first; hosted deployment, financial/growth closure, and later health/development loops remain deferred |
| Ambiguity | Local is the required full deployment now; hosted mode is optional future work; Docker, Colima, Railway, PostgreSQL, and OpenClaw are not local prerequisites or fallbacks |
| Evidence honesty | Current ASC snapshots are marked inconsistent; unavailable product metrics never become zero |
