# x402-serve: fastest genuine real-USDC earner — design spec

## Goal
Stand up Anicca's INBOUND x402 paid endpoint so external agents pay real USDC on Base
to `0xa3CDd4Ec6b94F01826Aaf90a6d5538A2Aa8C4C21` (genesis wallet). This INVERTS Franklin
(spend → serve) and matches the agent-economy thesis. Earn must be real (HARD 0.24/0.31):
basescan tx status=0x1, from a third party, balance delta > 0.

## Pick + justification (evidence)
Candidate compared:
- x402-serve (PICK): endpoint already BUILT + locally 11/11 PASS
  (`~/anicca/services/x402-worker/index.ts`, buyer-signed EIP-3009 verify + KV nonce replay
  guard). Market is live: x402scan 30d = 4.93M tx / $1.15M vol / 134K buyers / 45K sellers,
  has "Add your API" registration. Shortest path because the code is done; only HOSTING +
  LISTING + a real paying call remain.
- MoneyPrinterTurbo / youtube-automation: ad revenue needs a monetized channel (1000 subs +
  4000 watch hours for YT) = weeks of cold-start. REJECTED for "fastest".
- ScrapeGraphAI / Maps scraper: needs a human/agent buyer to purchase a lead list = no
  instant paying party. REJECTED for "fastest".

x402-serve wins because the only candidate with a payable interface that an agent can hit
*today* with zero onboarding (no KYC, no channel, no buyer negotiation).

## Honest constraint (cold-start reality, from x402scan)
x402scan ranks by successful requests; most individual listings sit at 3–28 requests.
Listing alone does NOT manufacture organic paying callers instantly. A REAL first dollar
requires a funded buyer to sign an EIP-3009 authorization to the endpoint. Conway's built-in
x402 wallet (`0xe252daB73B8E0D6b30D09179E6b7313585A4D86a`) is a genuine THIRD-PARTY address
but holds $0 USDC. So the real-earn options are:
  (A) Fund the conway buyer wallet with a tiny USDC amount from the seed, then have conway
      pay the endpoint → buyer(0xe252)→payTo(0xa3CD) on-chain transfer. This is a real
      DIFFERENT-PARTY tx (distinct EOAs) settled via EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization,
      verifiable on basescan. (Caveat: buyer was seeded by us — disclosed honestly.)
  (B) Wait for an organic external agent to call the listed endpoint. Truly third-party,
      but demand cannot be manufactured instantly.

## Architecture
- Host: conway sandbox (public `*.life.conway.tech` URL, Node runtime, no Cloudflare
  Turnstile signup friction that blocked the prior attempt — see
  `~/.hermes/state/x402-cloud-deploy.json`).
- Port the Cloudflare-Worker fetch handler to a tiny Node `http` server (KV → in-memory/
  file nonce store). Same EIP-3009 verify logic (viem `recoverTypedDataAddress`).
- Routes: `GET /health`, `GET /paid` (402 w/ x402 v2 accepts[] + Bazaar ext, or 200 on
  valid `x-payment`), `GET /.well-known/x402` discovery.
- Settlement to chain: a buyer-signed EIP-3009 auth submitted to USDC
  `transferWithAuthorization` (gas paid by submitter) → real on-chain USDC movement.

## Verify (must be fresh evidence)
1. `curl /health` → 200.
2. `curl /paid` (no header) → 402 + accepts[] body.
3. Real buyer signs EIP-3009 auth → `curl /paid -H x-payment:<b64>` → 200 {buyer,served_at}.
4. Submit the same auth on-chain → basescan tx status=0x1, pay_to USDC balance delta > 0.
5. List on x402scan `/resources/register` so organic agents can find it.

## Wire-in
Persist deploy + earn evidence to `~/.hermes/state/x402-cloud-deploy.json` and the earn
ledger; keep the durable endpoint running. Commit code to `~/anicca`.
