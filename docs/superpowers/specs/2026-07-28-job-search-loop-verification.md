# Job Search Loop — Live Verification

## Outcome

The loop reaches its daily target with two real, employer-confirmed applications and
retains independent browser, ledger, email, and Telegram evidence. The launchd
deployment runs the daily pass at 08:30 JST and polls Gmail every 15 minutes without
starting a model on empty inbox passes.

| Role | Employer | Confirmation |
|---|---|---|
| AI/LLM Division Research Engineer (R&D) | LayerX | Talentio returned success and LayerX sent an entry receipt |
| 生成AIエンジニア | エクスチュア株式会社 | HRMOS displayed its completion page and sent an application receipt |

Private application IDs, contact data, form payloads, and screenshots stay under
`~/.local/state/anicca/job-search/` and are not committed.

## Grounded claims and role evidence

## Verification commands

```bash
cd /path/to/rockstar_ibot/apps/job-search-loop
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
zsh -n scripts/run-daily.sh scripts/run-inbox.sh scripts/healthcheck.sh
plutil -lint launchd/*.plist
zsh scripts/healthcheck.sh
```

The healthcheck verifies both installed schedulers, SQLite
`PRAGMA integrity_check`, private file permissions, application state counts, and
fresh daily/inbox evidence.

## `JOB-CANONICAL-MERGE-1` verification

| Check | Current evidence |
|---|---|
| Legacy behavior baseline | 107 tests pass in 4.916 seconds from legacy commit `d86adf4d5f1422b28f6675ac7ffa08f3b9c7e987` |
| Canonical job runtime | 114 tests pass after adding live-cutover regression coverage |
| Canonical model runner | 7 tests pass |
| Path behavior | Temporary XDG roots and launchd destination resolve only inside the Rockstar_ibot checkout |
| Private env behavior | The loader reads only the requested key and does not execute unrelated dotenv lines |
| Runner configuration | Four job-loop task classes; no personal account, absolute user path, candidate profile, or gig route |
| Legacy source scan | No legacy checkout or private Gmail path in `apps/job-search-loop` or `runtime/agent-runner` |
| Live cutover | Both installed programs resolve under the Rockstar_ibot checkout; daily is 08:30 JST, inbox is 900 seconds, both last exit codes are 0 |

The first canonical bootstrap found one scheduler-ordering defect without creating
an application side effect: the daily runner returned `EX_TEMPFAIL` after its
durable token ledger reported `budget_blocked`. Two integration tests reproduce
the failure. The repaired contract exits zero for that honest terminal state and
also proves a full daily quota never initializes the browser or model.

The post-repair forced passes preserve the application counts at
`submitted=2, not_submitted=1` and the Telegram sent count at 7. Ledger,
interview-prep, and Telegram-outbox integrity are all `ok`. The redacted machine
receipt is
`docs/evidence/job-search-loop/2026-07-29-canonical-migration.json`.

PR #1273 passes shell syntax, changed-file PII, Python syntax/unittest,
changed-commit gitleaks, and TruffleHog in Security Scan run `30444708546`.
