# Connector Telegram and bundle recovery Item 12B plan

## Goal

Persist and validate the successful Telegram message and photo receipts so a recreated evidence chain sends only the missing delivery, then deterministically writes or reuses exactly one final applied bundle. Compose this with Item 12A so the four provider/Calendar/Telegram interruption boundaries preserve provider Submit zero, Calendar event one, and bundle one.

## Current evidence

- Item 12A is pushed at `3b7aec54d`. Its provider pointer validates the stored receipt and raw PNG, skips page rendering/screenshot/provider record on recovery, and always performs an independent Calendar find/create/readback.
- The current chain sends the message and photo sequentially but persists their positive IDs only in the final bundle. A photo or bundle failure therefore loses the earlier successful Telegram receipt and repeats that delivery on restart.
- The message transport already receives one stable event idempotency key. The photo transport returns a positive provider ID but has no reusable durable receipt in the chain.
- `immutableJson`, the event identity, mode-0600 state, positive message-ID parser, and final bundle schema are existing authorities to reuse.

## Ponytail full gate

- Add no database, queue, retry loop, transport, Telegram API, service, provider abstraction, schedule, or browser action.
- Reuse the Item 12A event identity and checkpoint directory. Add only exact immutable message/photo stage receipts; never store Telegram target, message/caption body, title, venue, attendee, ticket ID, raw PNG, or private profile in them.
- Do not persist a stale Calendar authority. Every invocation still validates provider evidence and independently reads Calendar. A stored delivery receipt is usable only when its exact Calendar event ID/URL and event identity match the current readback.
- Do not change runner continuation in this slice. A completed bundle may return idempotently; continuing to the next candidate is Item 13.
- Preserve external ordering: provider evidence → Calendar independent readback → Telegram message receipt → Telegram photo receipt → immutable bundle.

## Implementation slice

Luna owns only:

1. `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-minimal-evidence.test.js`
2. `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-minimal-evidence.js`
3. `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-minimal-runner.test.js` (one composed pre-readback integration only; runner production is unchanged)

Revised soft target after fresh review: 3 files; evidence production +70–120 LOC; evidence tests +90–130 LOC; runner integration test +35–70 LOC. Reuse the existing checkpoint validation and helpers; no broad evidence-chain rewrite and no runner production change.

Final size: evidence production +119/-10 LOC, evidence tests +106/-1 LOC, and runner integration test +28 LOC. The runner test stayed below its revised soft target by reusing its existing fixture; runner production remained unchanged.

### RED

1. Message succeeds and photo fails. A recreated chain validates the message receipt, skips message resend, retries only the photo, and writes one bundle. Message successful effect total one.
2. Message and photo succeed but final bundle write fails. After the filesystem blocker is removed, a recreated chain skips both Telegram calls and writes one bundle with the original positive IDs.
3. A completed chain invoked again validates provider evidence and current Calendar readback, sends neither Telegram artifact, and returns the same bundle ID with bundle file count one.
4. Message failure persists no message/photo checkpoint and writes no bundle. Photo failure persists only the message checkpoint and writes no bundle.
5. Each delivery checkpoint is atomic, mode 0600, exact-schema, identity-bound, and contains no target, message/caption, title, venue, attendee, ticket ID, canonical URL, raw PNG, or private value.
6. Missing message before photo, wrong provider/event/URL hash/artifact/calendar identity, non-positive or unsafe provider IDs, invalid JSON/extra keys, mismatched stage, file/parent symlink, and bundle collision fail before any missing Telegram delivery or bundle write. Provider and Calendar read-only validation remains allowed where required.
7. The full composed interruption matrix proves: provider PNG/ticket checkpoint recovery, Calendar create/readback crash recovery, message-success/photo-failure recovery, and photo-success/bundle-failure recovery. Final totals are external registration one, Calendar create one, durable bundle one, provider Submit zero.
8. Existing first-pass Luma/Peatix complete bundles and every partial-failure no-bundle contract remain unchanged.
9. A real minimal-runner integration starts from parent pre-readback `registered`, composes the real evidence chain across the interruption fixtures, and instruments cache/direct/Harness Submit paths. It must prove one registered external state, every Submit path zero, Calendar create one, and final bundle one; counting an unused synthetic label is forbidden.

### GREEN

- Derive one delivery identity from provider/event/canonical URL hash/provider receipt/artifact SHA. Use fixed message and photo checkpoint paths below the existing checkpoint root and reject symlinked components before reads, sends, or writes.
- Read and exact-validate any message/photo receipt before Calendar. After the mandatory current Calendar readback, require the stored Calendar ID/URL to match before reuse.
- Immediately after a positive message ID, atomically write the message receipt with the first successful Calendar readback timestamp. After a positive photo ID, atomically write the photo receipt bound to the message receipt and artifact identity.
- On recovery, send only an absent stage. A photo receipt without its matching message receipt is invalid.
- The photo receipt must match the message receipt's positive message ID and first Calendar readback timestamp in addition to its checkpoint SHA; duplicated fields may never diverge.
- Build the final bundle from the stable message checkpoint timestamp and the two positive IDs. If the bundle already exists, require byte-identical immutable content and return the same bundle.
- Preserve the existing bundle `created_at` meaning as the provider evidence first-observed timestamp; only `calendar_readback_at` comes from the stable message receipt.
- Assert the final bundle path is state-root-contained and symlink-free before write/reuse.

## Verify

- Focused evidence suite; minimal runner pre-registered Submit-zero regression; minimal production; Peatix workflow/store/Harness; native entrypoint; changed-file syntax; `git diff --check`.
- Fresh Sol review for delivery identity, corrupt receipts, checkpoint ordering, Telegram duplicates, bundle determinism/collision, Calendar freshness, privacy, symlink/root escape, Luma/Peatix non-regression, and absence of provider Submit paths.
- The corruption matrix must exercise photo-specific message ID/timestamp/checkpoint-SHA mismatch, message-missing/photo-present, delivery receipt/artifact mismatch, unsafe message/photo IDs, file and parent symlinks, and bundle symlink/immutable collision.
- Update SSOT, commit, and push. Mark Item 12 complete only when the full four-boundary composed fixture passes with registration one, Calendar one, bundle one, and Submit zero. Keep production schedule unloaded.

## Result

- Luna reproduced all five initial delivery failures, then added exact immutable message/photo receipts below the existing checkpoint root. Recovery validates receipt syntax and identity before Calendar, independently reads current Calendar, and reuses a delivery only when its event ID/URL matches.
- Photo receipts bind the message checkpoint SHA, positive message ID, first Calendar readback timestamp, provider/event/canonical hash/provider receipt, and artifact ref/SHA. Orphan, divergent, corrupt, unsafe-ID, file/parent symlink, bundle symlink, and immutable collision fixtures fail closed.
- A message-success/photo-failure restart sends only the photo. A photo-success/bundle-failure restart sends neither delivery and writes one deterministic bundle. A completed rerun returns the same bundle ID and leaves bundle count one.
- The final bundle preserves provider first-observed `created_at`; its stable `calendar_readback_at` comes from the message receipt. Provider evidence and Calendar are still validated on every invocation.
- A real minimal-runner integration composes parent pre-readback `registered` with the real evidence chain. It observes one registered external state, calls cache/direct/Harness Submit paths zero times, creates Calendar once, records provider evidence once, and ends with one bundle across the interruption sequence.
- Luna focused evidence 16/16 and runner 16/16 passed with all named adjacent suites. Sol independently reran the frozen expanded suite at 90/90 plus three-file syntax and `git diff --check`. The three unchanged baseline failures remain isolated to the date-dependent Peatix fixture and old native provider expectations.
- Fresh Sol review found three Important gaps, the plan was revised before fixes, and final re-review returned `ship`. Item 12 is complete; Item 13 is next. Production schedule remains unloaded.
