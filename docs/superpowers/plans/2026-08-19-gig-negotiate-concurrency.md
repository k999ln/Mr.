# Gig Negotiate Concurrency Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Detect every new actionable Coconala buyer message within 30 seconds, judge up to two changed threads concurrently, send each authorized reply exactly once, and retain official readback without adding a fifth business lane or a second supervised service.

**Architecture:** The existing Negotiate launchd owner becomes one long-lived parent. A fast producer reads only the newest inbox page, writes a typed inbox event to the existing SQLite outbox before any model work, and dispatches the durable thread identity to two in-process consumer tasks. Consumers collect and judge one direct-message thread each; the existing reply lane keeps the pre-send freshness, click authorization, duplicate fence and official readback. Full four-page reconciliation runs as a lower-priority coroutine and never blocks the producer.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3 standard library (`asyncio`, `sqlite3`, `subprocess`), existing CloakBrowser CDP helpers, existing `connector-outbox.sqlite3`, pytest.

**Spec:** `skills/earn/gig/TODO.md` §0b

## Global Constraints

- Keep exactly four business lanes: Apply, Negotiate, Paid and Storefront.
- Keep one Negotiate launchd label and one long-lived supervised parent; no observer service, fifth lane, new database, broker or dependency.
- The producer interval is at most 30 seconds and durable outbox enqueue happens before semantic/model work.
- Start with exactly two semantic consumers. Each browser operation owns its own CDP page/target; never select `pages()[0]` or require front focus.
- Semantic judgment remains `reply-semantic-agent`, Luna medium, one candidate, tool-disabled, 60-second runner deadline and no slow fallback.
- Existing pre-send freshness, paid-room refusal, near-duplicate suppression, click authorization, official readback and replay idempotency remain mandatory.
- An in-memory `asyncio.Queue` is dispatch only; SQLite remains the restart/replay source of truth.
- Full four-page reconciliation remains present but yields to urgent claimed work.
- No customer body, credential, seller identity or runtime evidence enters the public tree or logs.
- Completion requires a natural buyer-origin → detection → judgment → click → official-readback receipt within five minutes; operating target is at most two minutes.

### Task 1: First-page observation and pre-semantic durable identity

**Status:** Complete and fresh-Sol reviewed (`3a8d76338`, `09257bb4a`; verdict `SHIP`).

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/scripts/connector_outbox.py`
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/scripts/coconala_queue_snapshot.py`
- Create: `skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `coconala_inbox_event_key(thread_id: str, identity_sha256: str) -> str`
- Produces: `direct_inbox_coverage_expression(page_limit: int = 10) -> str`
- Produces CLI mode `direct-inbox-head-only`, returning `collector_mode`, `captured_at`, `inquiries`, `head_only: true`, and `read_only: true` without semantic work or a full-coverage claim.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing identity and bounded-head tests**

Add literal assertions to `test_reply_concurrency.py`:

```python
def test_inbox_event_key_is_thread_bound_and_rejects_non_sha_identity():
    assert outbox.coconala_inbox_event_key("123", "a" * 64) == (
        "coconala:inbox:v1:123:sha256_v1:" + "a" * 64
    )
    assert outbox.validate_coconala_event_key(
        "coconala:inbox:v1:123:sha256_v1:" + "a" * 64, "123"
    ).startswith("coconala:inbox:v1:123:")
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        outbox.coconala_inbox_event_key("123", "not-a-sha")
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        outbox.validate_coconala_event_key(
            "coconala:inbox:v1:123:sha256_v1:" + "a" * 64, "999"
        )


def test_head_expression_reads_one_page_without_changing_full_expression():
    assert snapshot.direct_inbox_coverage_expression() == snapshot.DIRECT_INBOX_COVERAGE_EXPRESSION
    head = snapshot.direct_inbox_coverage_expression(1)
    assert "pageLimit=1" in head
    assert "pageLimit=10" not in head
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        snapshot.direct_inbox_coverage_expression(0)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED**

Run: `python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py`

Expected: FAIL because both public helpers are absent.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the typed inbox event**

In `connector_outbox.py`, add a strict `_INBOX_EVENT` grammar beside `_MESSAGE_EVENT`, build the exact key above, include it in `validate_coconala_event_key`, and classify it as a normal—not estimate—event. Do not change the schema or add a table.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the bounded head collector mode**

In `coconala_queue_snapshot.py`:

1. Add `direct_inbox_coverage_expression`; accept only real integers `1..MAX_PAGINATION_PAGES` and preserve the existing expression byte-for-byte at the default.
2. Allow `inspect_page`/`inspect_message_page` to receive a custom coverage expression and to skip full-coverage validation only when explicitly requested.
3. Add parser choice `direct-inbox-head-only`.
4. In that mode, open one owned `DefaultTab`, evaluate one-page coverage, normalize cards with `inquiries_from_dom`, and write a snapshot with `head_only: true`, `semantic_ssot: false`, and no message body. Do not call `SemanticJudge`; do not claim `coverage_complete`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run GREEN and regressions**

Run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py
python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_semantic_fast_route.py
python3 -m py_compile skills/earn/gig/scripts/connector_outbox.py skills/earn/gig/scripts/coconala_queue_snapshot.py
```

Expected: all pass; no warning or error output.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/earn/gig/scripts/connector_outbox.py skills/earn/gig/scripts/coconala_queue_snapshot.py skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py
git commit -m "feat(gig): claim new buyer messages before semantics"
```

### Task 2: One-thread semantic worker using the existing effect lane

**Status:** Complete and fresh-Sol reviewed through `6f1c659ba`; focused regression
`32 passed`; verdict `SHIP`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/scripts/coconala_queue_snapshot.py`
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/scripts/reply_detector.py`
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: exact `action_id`, typed inbox `event_key`, thread id and observed head identity already stored in `ConnectorOutbox`
- Produces CLI mode `direct-thread-only --talkroom-id <id>` with exactly one inquiry and `semantic_ssot: true`
- Produces: `run_targeted_thread(args, *, action_id: int, inbox_event_key: str, thread_id: str, evidence: Path, run_id: str) -> dict[str, Any]`
- Produces: a fresh, complete `orders-only` receipt and paid-room fence collected after semantics and immediately before any reply or estimate effect

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing targeted-thread test**

Create a fixture whose direct thread ends with buyer message `buyer-2`, whose semantic receipt authorizes body `回答です`, and whose fake lane result contains one officially verified reply. Assert:

```python
result = detector.run_targeted_thread(
    args, action_id=action_id, inbox_event_key=inbox_event_key,
    thread_id="123", evidence=tmp_path / "evidence", run_id="run-1"
)
assert result["status"] == "completed"
assert result["replied"] == 1
assert result["thread_id"] == "123"
assert result["official_readback"] == 1
assert all("123" in command for command in recorded_collect_commands)
```

The fake scripts must write the complete snapshot/queue/lane JSON shapes consumed by the real function. Assert filesystem results and returned values, not mock call counts alone.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED**

Run: `python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py::test_targeted_thread_reaches_official_readback`

Expected: FAIL because the targeted collector and worker do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add `direct-thread-only`**

Validate the supplied thread id with the existing direct-message route grammar, open exactly `https://coconala.com/mypage/direct_message/<id>` in its own `DefaultTab`, call `direct_message_event` with the existing semantic judge and official-context provider, and emit one inquiry. Preserve message identity, buyer timestamp, semantic receipt and estimate fields. Invalid route, missing identity or semantic failure remains fail-closed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Extract the targeted worker from the existing pass**

`run_targeted_thread` must validate that `action_id`, `inbox_event_key` and `thread_id`
name the same pending durable action. It must then reuse one shared effect pipeline, also called
by the existing full pass, in this order:

1. `direct-thread-only` collection;
2. `reply_queue.py build` and `reply_queue.py enqueue`, confirming the collected message event
   coalesces into the supplied `action_id` before any marketplace effect;
3. explicit semantic-action allowlist validation; unknown or failed actions remain pending;
4. a fresh `direct-inbox-head-only` re-read proving the supplied inbox identity is still current;
5. a fresh `orders-only` collection with complete coverage, followed by `build-paid`; do not
   accept a caller-supplied, cached or stale registry;
6. requested-estimate effect/readback when required, otherwise existing
   `reply_lane.py --max-model-calls 0` for normal replies;
7. return only bounded counts and verified event metadata. A positive `replied` count without
   matching verified official events is recoverable pending/failure, never `completed`.

Extract the queue/effect/readback sequence from the existing full-pass block rather than copying
it into a second 300-line implementation. The full pass and targeted pass must call the same
function for build/enqueue, estimate ordering, paid fence, reply lane and readback classification.

If semantic judgment is one of the explicitly supported intentional no-send actions, revalidate
the exact head identity, claim only the supplied unchanged action/revision and close it through
the existing `nothing_to_say` closure. A catch-all semantic action must never close an action.
If the head identity changed, semantic judgment failed, orders coverage is incomplete, or the
fresh paid proof is absent/stale, leave the exact action pending for bounded retry; never close it
as success and never send.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add replay and no-send tests**

Add two behavior tests:

```python
def test_targeted_replay_has_zero_second_effect(...):
    first = detector.run_targeted_thread(...)
    second = detector.run_targeted_thread(...)
    assert first["official_readback"] == 1
    assert second["replied"] == 0
    assert second["duplicate_effect"] == 0


def test_intentional_no_send_closes_claim_without_reply(...):
    result = detector.run_targeted_thread(...)
    assert result["replied"] == 0
    assert result["closed_without_send"] == 1
    assert ConnectorOutbox(database, manifest).pending_actions() == []
```

Also add negative tests proving: wrong inbox identity cannot close an action; a newer head identity
prevents send/closure; an unknown semantic action remains pending; orders proof is collected after
semantics and before normal or estimate effect; stale/incomplete orders proof blocks both effect
paths; and `replied > 0` without matching official readback cannot return `completed`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN and focused regressions**

Run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py
python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_semantic_fast_route.py
python3 -m py_compile skills/earn/gig/scripts/reply_detector.py skills/earn/gig/scripts/coconala_queue_snapshot.py
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/earn/gig/scripts/reply_detector.py skills/earn/gig/scripts/coconala_queue_snapshot.py skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py
git commit -m "feat(gig): process one changed buyer thread"
```

### Task 2.5: Prompt-only commitment consistency

**Status:** Complete through `f97c12d37`; deterministic semantic tests `10 passed`.
Real Luna evaluation returned direct audited replies for both observed regressions: the logo
case accepted the explicit August 20 15:00 rough deadline without clarification, and the
SaaS/Wix case used only the verified approximately 3% to 10% fact and confirmed the applied
JPY 27,000 implementation scope.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/scripts/requested_estimate.py`
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_semantic_fast_route.py`
- Update private runtime data: `~/.config/anicca/job-search/profile.json`

**Scope:** This is a prompt and verified-fact correction only. Do not add a database,
business lane, agent service, action type, browser effect, or schema. Keep the existing
reply and estimate paths.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add RED prompt contracts for the two observed failures**

The prompt must distinguish current capability/commitment from prior-client history. An
official application is verified proof that the seller committed to the application scope;
it is not proof of an unstated past client project. When the current buyer asks whether the
seller can perform work inside that applied scope, missing application context requests
`required_official_context=application`; after context is present the answer begins with a
clear `対応可能です` and proceeds with the requested work or concrete submission. It must
not emit `対応可能とはお約束できません` or volunteer an absence of experience.

Cover the real regressions: the Care Earth Mart applied logo-brush-up/sample request and the
Wix/SaaS LP implementation-and-CVR question.

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the user-verified SaaS LP fact**

Add one private fact and whitelist its ID: a client SaaS LP improved approximately 3% to 10%
visitor-to-start conversion after structure/design refinement, moving the CTA into the upper
first-view area, and rewriting the copy. Do not expose the private path, evidence field or
internal ID to a buyer.

- [ ] **Step 3: Make the minimum prompt change**

Bump the prompt version. Replace the blanket refusal rules with these bright lines:

1. For legal/platform-permitted work inside a verified current application or seller offer,
   state capability clearly and fulfill the buyer's requested next step using the existing
   response path.
2. Do not fabricate an unstated customer, portfolio item or result number. Do not volunteer
   missing experience; answer with the verified transferable fact, applied commitment and a
   concrete deliverable.
3. Only illegal, unsafe or platform-prohibited work may be refused outright.
4. Keep explicit purchase/estimate authorization and exact estimate-term gates unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run deterministic tests and a real-model semantic eval**

Run the focused prompt tests, existing semantic fast-route tests, and one real Luna semantic
evaluation for each observed regression. Both final replies must answer the buyer directly,
contain no refusal phrase, contain no unsupported prior-client claim, and pass the existing
reply audit.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit and fresh-Sol review**

Commit only the tracked prompt/test change. Private seller facts remain outside Git. A fresh
read-only Sol reviewer verifies the observed failures, honesty boundary, and unchanged estimate
authorization before this task closes.

### Task 3: One supervised producer–consumer runtime

**Status:** Implemented and deployed from immutable release `1f849cf4b`. Launchctl
readback proves one KeepAlive Negotiate process with `--poll-seconds 30 --workers 2`;
three natural head probes completed about 34 seconds apart with zero new stderr. The natural
buyer-message-to-official-readback latency gate remains pending the next real unread message.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/scripts/reply_detector.py`
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/config/launchd-jobs.json`
- Modify: `skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: head snapshots and `run_targeted_thread`
- Produces: `async supervise_replies(args, *, probe, worker, reconcile, stop) -> None`
- Production CLI: `reply_detector.py --continuous --poll-seconds 30 --workers 2`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write RED concurrency tests**

Use real `asyncio.Event` barriers and literal timestamps. The first fake worker waits; the probe emits a second identity before that barrier is released. Assert the second durable claim exists before worker 1 completes and both worker start events occur concurrently:

```python
assert claim_times["identity-2"] < finish_times["identity-1"]
assert max(worker_started.values()) < min(worker_finished.values())
assert max_active_workers == 2
```

Add restart coverage by pre-populating an inbox event in SQLite, starting the supervisor with the same head identity, and asserting the pending action is dispatched once. Add replied-event coverage asserting a duplicate head identity creates no second effect.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED**

Run: `python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py -k 'slow or restart or workers'`

Expected: FAIL because `supervise_replies` is absent.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the standard-library supervisor**

Use one `asyncio.Queue[InboxWork]`, one producer task, two consumer tasks and one reconciliation task.

- Producer: every `poll_seconds`, execute the head collector with `asyncio.to_thread`; for each unread row with a valid identity, call `ConnectorOutbox.enqueue(coconala_inbox_event_key(...))` before `queue.put`. Dispatch the returned `action_id`, exact event key, thread id and identity together. Skip an already terminal/replied duplicate. A pending duplicate after restart is re-dispatched with the same durable tuple.
- Consumers: keep an in-memory set only to suppress duplicate simultaneous dispatch; call `run_targeted_thread` with the exact durable tuple through `asyncio.to_thread`; always release the in-memory marker in `finally`.
- Reconciler: when the urgent queue and in-flight set are empty, run the existing full pass at the existing five-minute reconciliation cadence. Producer and consumers continue independently while it runs.
- Shutdown: SIGTERM/SIGINT sets `stop`; cancel tasks, await them, release the lane lock and leave SQLite claims recoverable. Do not delete state.

- [ ] **Step 4: Make launchd supervise the parent**

For the existing `ai.anicca.hf-gig-reply-detector` job only:

- append `--continuous --poll-seconds 30 --workers 2`;
- replace `StartInterval` with `KeepAlive: true`;
- keep `RunAtLoad: true` and `ThrottleInterval: 30`;
- do not change Apply, Paid, Storefront, release or browser jobs.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run GREEN and manifest regression**

Run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py
python3 -m pytest -q skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_semantic_fast_route.py
python3 -m json.tool skills/earn/gig/config/launchd-jobs.json >/dev/null
python3 -m py_compile skills/earn/gig/scripts/reply_detector.py
git diff --check
```

Expected: all pass. The semantic-fast-route manifest test must now assert Negotiate `KeepAlive: true`, no `StartInterval`, exact CLI values `30` and `2`, and unchanged intervals for the other lanes.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/earn/gig/scripts/reply_detector.py skills/earn/gig/config/launchd-jobs.json skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_concurrency.py skills/earn/gig/tests/test_reply_semantic_fast_route.py
git commit -m "feat(gig): keep negotiate discovery live during replies"
```

## Primary-agent rollout gate

After all three reviewed tasks:

1. Run the complete gig test suite and classify every failure against the pre-change baseline.
2. Run gitleaks/PII changed-path checks; customer content and runtime evidence must be zero.
3. Obtain fresh Sol Advisor verdict on the full diff; fix every Critical/Important finding and re-review.
4. Merge/push to `main`, build an immutable release, install only the Negotiate job, and read back the loaded plist argv/environment.
5. Observe one natural no-op/reconciliation cycle: process stays resident, head polling continues, other three lane PIDs/schedules remain independent, model calls are zero when nothing changed.
6. Observe the next natural actionable buyer message and record buyer origin, durable claim, semantic start/end, click and official readback. Require at most five minutes, target at most two minutes, second wake/effect zero.
7. Update `skills/earn/gig/TODO.md` only from those receipts; do not publish an after-speed claim before step 6.
