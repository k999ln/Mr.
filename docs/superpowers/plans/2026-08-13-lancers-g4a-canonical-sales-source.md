# Lancers G4A Canonical Sales Source Implementation Plan

## Goal

Replace the mutable, fulfillment-only `work-sync` runtime with one canonical, exact-release, read-only 5-minute source that sees both application replies and storefront inquiry/order boards. It must not send, click, mutate provider state, append ledger events, or claim a contract.

## Ponytail decision

Reuse the existing `ai.anicca.lancers-revenue-work-sync` owner, account/browser lock, Playwright CDP session, exact-SHA installer, and release manifest. Do not add a scheduler, DB, schema, queue, model call, or generic marketplace abstraction.

Rejected:

- Copying the 274-line deployed observer unchanged: it watches only `working` and can emit `order_awarded` without an official contract receipt.
- Keeping the old owner and adding `sales-loop`: it creates two polling owners for one account and one source.
- Adding `ContractReceipt`/capacity now: the current official board has empty `with`, so no complete contract instance exists to validate.

The release plumbing makes this five touched files even though the behavior is one small source. Skipping those files would leave mutable repo-external code in production.

## Ownership and size

Luna/Terra owns all production code, tests, commands, commit, and push for this plan. Primary Sol owns this plan, acceptance, deployment decision, and final evidence.

| File | Change | Soft target |
|---|---|---:|
| `skills/earn/lancers/scripts/work_sync.py` | canonical read-only boards/detail/messages tick | 90–130 production LOC |
| `apps/lancers-revenue/tests/test_work_sync.py` | normal snapshot plus duplicate/failure/secret regressions | 100–150 test LOC |
| `apps/lancers-revenue/launchd/ai.anicca.lancers-revenue-work-sync.plist` | existing 300s owner template, no `RunAtLoad` | 25–35 LOC |
| `apps/lancers-revenue/scripts/install-local.sh` | archive/render the work-sync exact-release file and plist | 25–45 changed LOC |
| `apps/lancers-revenue/tests/test_install_local.py` | manifest/path/schedule/single-owner assertions | 20–35 changed LOC |

Production exceeds the normal 100 LOC/3-file soft target only because source ownership and exact-release deployment are part of the same safety boundary. No shared contract, schema, ledger, reporter, application, or listing files change.

## Direct implementation

Do not run a RED-first phase. Implement the finished contract directly, then add only the regressions below and run the existing suites.

### 1. Canonical bounded source

Implement `work_sync.py` using the existing `application_tick.py` loader and helpers for `CDP_URL`, account readiness, `account_lock`, owned page creation/close, and Playwright cleanup.

One tick must:

1. Acquire the existing `work-sync.json` account lock.
2. Verify the owned browser and logged-in Lancers account.
3. Use page-context same-origin `fetch` with credentials to GET the official boards list, then each bounded board detail and messages resource.
4. Treat boards/messages as arrays and detail as an object. Validate raw snake_case fields. IDs must be non-empty opaque strings or integers normalized to strings.
5. Follow the provider's observed cursors: boards use `limit=20&modified=<last modified>`; message history uses `limit=20&message_id=<oldest id>&direction=prev`. Stop only on an empty page within the bounded maximum. Duplicate conflicts, a non-advancing cursor, malformed envelopes, HTTP failure, or reaching the maximum before an empty page fail closed.
6. Correlate only explicit `with.proposal.id`, `with.job.id`, and `with.serviceItemContract.id`. Empty/missing `with` remains unknown and never becomes a contract.
7. Return a deterministic JSON snapshot with `ok`, `logged_in`, `source_complete`, `board_count`, `required_reply_count`, `unread_count`, `application_board_count`, `storefront_contract_candidate_count`, and opaque board/message IDs plus SHA-256 hashes where needed for identity.
8. Never output message bodies, names, emails, cookies, headers, tokens, or arbitrary provider payloads.
9. Never call POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, click provider actions, call a model, append ledger events, or modify application/listing state.
10. Guarantee bounded process exit after the JSON line. Page/runtime cleanup exceptions, including Playwright dialog teardown races, must be caught and converted to a stable failed result without leaving the Python or driver process spinning.

If the provider envelope cannot prove completeness, return `ok=false`, `source_complete=false`, and a stable error. Do not report zero leads from an incomplete source.

### 2. Exact-release owner

Add the work-sync file to the immutable release archive and manifest. Render the existing work-sync label to the release path with `--json`, `WorkingDirectory=release`, `StartInterval=300`, `ProcessType=Background`, `Umask=63`, isolated stdout/stderr paths, and no `RunAtLoad`.

The installer must not call `launchctl`. It only writes exact-release artifacts atomically, matching the existing application/reporter pattern. There must be one work-sync plist and one work-sync label.

### 3. Minimal regressions

After implementation, verify only:

- A valid snake_case board/detail/messages fixture produces a complete sanitized snapshot and correct application/storefront candidate counts.
- Empty `with` stays unknown and produces no contract/event/ledger write.
- Duplicate board/message ID, malformed/incomplete provider response, or unsupported truncation fails closed.
- The serialized result does not contain fixture message text, buyer identity, cookie, token, or arbitrary payload fields.
- Installer manifest contains `work_sync.py`; rendered plist uses the immutable release path, 300 seconds, no `RunAtLoad`, and no unresolved placeholders.
- Cleanup failure regression proves `main` returns a stable non-zero result and does not escape an unhandled teardown exception. Live process exit is verified during deployment, not mocked as proof.

Run the new focused test, all `apps/lancers-revenue/tests`, agent-runner tests, `py_compile` for release Python files, plist lint, JSON output parse, and production diff check. Record exact counts and SHA.

## One adversarial review

Use one fresh Sol adversarial verifier, exactly once. It must try to disprove:

1. every provider call is read-only;
2. incomplete or malformed source cannot be reported as zero/healthy;
3. empty `with` cannot become `contract_active` or `order_awarded`;
4. message content or secrets cannot escape in JSON/logs;
5. only one 300-second work-sync owner exists and it points to an exact release;
6. application/listing state and ledger are not written.
7. one tick cannot remain resident or spin after emitting JSON, including on browser/page/runtime cleanup failure.

Critical/Important findings return once to the same implementer. Primary then performs mechanical verification; no second review.

### Recorded one-shot review corrections

The sole review returned `FIX_FIRST`; there is no second review. The same implementer must make exactly these corrections before primary mechanical verification:

1. Open the existing sibling `marketplace-ledger.sqlite3` with SQLite URI `mode=ro`. Read only the exact `external_id` set for `platform=lancers AND event_type=application_verified`. Count an application board only when `with.proposal.id` is in that verified set. Missing ledger, query/schema failure, or conflicting duplicate identity fails closed. Never initialize, migrate, checkpoint, or append the ledger. Tests must include one verified ID and one non-receipt proposal ID and prove only the former counts.
2. Make the launchd-facing invocation a parent watchdog in this same script. It starts one hidden worker invocation in a new process group; the worker owns Playwright and performs the tick. The parent enforces a 120-second whole-tick deadline, requires exactly one valid sanitized JSON line and the expected exit status, and treats unexpected stderr/invalid output as failure. On deadline or incomplete exit, terminate and then kill the entire worker process group so the Playwright driver cannot remain orphaned. Return one stable nonzero JSON result such as `tick_timeout`/`worker_failed`. Do not add a file, service, scheduler, or daemon.
3. Add a real subprocess watchdog regression using a harmless child fixture/hidden test hook or a narrowly injectable process command: prove the parent returns within the test bound, kills a descendant in the same process group, and emits one parseable failure JSON. Retain the cleanup-exception regression. Production launchd must not expose the test hook.

These corrections may exceed the original production LOC soft target because the observed orphan consumed CPU for more than a day. Keep the implementation local to `work_sync.py`; do not introduce a general supervisor abstraction.

## Deploy and live acceptance

Primary records pre-deploy SHA-256 for application state, listing state, and ledger. After the implementation commit is on `origin/main`, install the exact main SHA, lint the rendered plist, replace the existing mutable work-sync owner, and kickstart that real launchd owner once.

This is a production scheduler/state change, so announce it immediately before execution. The live tick is read-only but must be real, not mock/dry-run.

Accept only when:

- exit code is 0 and stderr is empty;
- stdout is one valid sanitized JSON snapshot from official boards/detail/messages;
- the deployed manifest and plist point to the exact main release;
- one work-sync label is loaded at 300 seconds;
- the kicked process exits within the bounded observation window, launchd returns idle, and no orphan work-sync Python/Playwright driver remains;
- application/listing/ledger hashes match pre-deploy values;
- no provider message, offer, order, listing, application, or ledger event is created.

## Next item after G4A

Update the SSOT with the observed source shape and evidence, then close Storefront integrity/canonicalization read-only. Only after a complete official `serviceItemContract` instance is observed do G4B `ContractReceipt`, G3C capacity, and G4C reply/offer actions begin.
