# Job Inbox Partial Acknowledgement 10G Implementation Plan

> **Execution guard:** Use Superpowers test-driven-development and
> verification-before-completion. A thread is acknowledged only after the
> executor returns a schema-valid durable outcome for that exact thread.

**Goal:** A partially successful inbox pass marks only the Gmail thread IDs it
actually processed, leaving every unprocessed candidate visible to the next
15-minute pass.

**Architecture:** Extend the validated inbox result with a unique
`processed_thread_ids` array. After the agent runner succeeds, resolve its
fresh result path from the runner-owned summary. A deterministic acknowledgement
function verifies that the IDs are valid, unique, a subset of the scanned
candidates, and consistent with `processed_threads`; it then atomically merges
only those IDs into private seen state. Unknown IDs, mismatched counts, missing
results, or runner failure acknowledge nothing.

**Tech stack:** Python standard library (`json`, `pathlib`), JSON Schema, zsh,
and `unittest`.

## Task 1 — RED: partial acknowledgement

- [x] Test that one processed ID marks only that candidate seen.
- [x] Test that an unprocessed candidate remains unseen.
- [x] Test that an unknown ID or count mismatch fails closed and marks nothing.
- [x] Test schema requires unique processed IDs.
- [x] Test the shell resolves the runner result and passes it to deterministic
  acknowledgement.
- [x] Run focused tests and capture expected failures: missing
  `mark_processed_threads`, missing result-path wiring, and missing schema field.

## Task 2 — GREEN: result-bound acknowledgement

- [x] Implement strict candidate/result validation and atomic partial mark.
- [x] Add `processed_thread_ids` to prompt and result schema.
- [x] Resolve only the current runner result in `run-inbox.sh`.
- [x] Keep runner failure and missing result fail-closed.
- [x] Run focused and full suites: 19 focused, 165 job-loop, and 9 runner
  tests pass; shell syntax, schema JSON, Python compile, and diff checks pass.

## Task 3 — GitHub and live reflection

- [x] Push, pass all CI, merge, and fast-forward canonical.
- [x] Kickstart only the existing inbox launchd job and verify exit zero,
  integrity, and no false-positive processing.
- [x] Update SSOT evidence; keep real partial-message E2E pending until a real
  pass contains multiple candidate threads with mixed outcomes.

Live result: PR #1326 merged as `aa81e7dff` after all seven required checks
passed in run `30455795192`. The canonical inbox advanced 16→17 with exit 0,
kept its mode-0600 three-thread seen checkpoint unchanged on the no-work path,
and reported no new recruiting email. Ledger and interview-prep integrity remain
`ok`.
