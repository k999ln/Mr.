# Connector Meetup discovery-audit persistence plan

## Goal

Persist the existing privacy-safe five-count Meetup discovery audit so an official no-effect wake proves whether discovery observed, normalized, filtered, and Calendar-blocked candidates.

## Measured evidence

- Official wake `wake-698594817b79bbe91ab869a5` reused all current Peatix bundles, then executed Meetup provider discovery for 48,171 ms on the same owned rail. It returned no candidate and completed `existing_bundles_reused` with positive Telegram ID `11483`.
- `createMinimalProductionDependencies` already supplies `operations.recordMeetupDiscoveryAudit || noop`, but `createMinimalProductionOperations` exposes only Luma, Connpass, and Peatix audit writers. No Meetup audit file exists.
- Isolated default Meetup workflow with the real Calendar measured exactly `14/12/12/1/0` for observed/normalized/window/free-open/calendar-free and candidate count zero. The only strict free event overlaps an existing timed Connector Calendar event, so the skip is correct.

## Ponytail full gate

- Copy/tweak the existing Peatix aggregate-audit writer and reuse `safeDiscoveryAudit`, `append`, mode 0600, wake ID, and timestamp validation.
- Change only operations production/test. Add no provider query, browser action, candidate data, URL, title, event ID, Calendar logic, state schema version, retry, schedule, or new module.
- Persist aggregate integer counts only to `meetup-discovery-audits.jsonl`.

## Luna implementation slice

Luna owns only:

1. `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-minimal-operations.test.js`
2. `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-minimal-operations.js`

Soft target: 2 files; production +4–8 LOC; tests +30–45 LOC.

### RED

1. `recordMeetupDiscoveryAudit` is callable and writes exactly one mode-0600 JSONL row with schema version, wake ID, five counts, and exact recorded time.
2. Invalid monotonic counts reject without appending a second row.
3. Persisted bytes contain no URL, event ID, title, profile, ticket, auth, or private value.
4. Existing Luma/Connpass/Peatix audit and report/action operations remain unchanged.

### GREEN

- Add `meetup-discovery-audits.jsonl` beside the three existing files.
- Add one writer using the existing safe validator and exact timestamp.
- Export that writer in the frozen operations object; production factory already consumes it.

## Verification

- Operations focused RED/GREEN, then production, Meetup workflow, runner, evidence, Harness adjacent suites; syntax and diff checks.
- Fresh Sol review for aggregate-only privacy, monotonic validation, file mode/path, production consumption, and no behavior changes.
- Sol merges, updates SSOT, pushes both branches, then runs one schedule-unloaded official wake. Acceptance is a new Meetup audit row matching the official discovery lineage, positive every-wake report, and exact target cleanup.

## Result

- Luna RED was operations 8/9 with the exact missing-method failure. GREEN commit `189b57bc8` adds only the Meetup JSONL path, one existing-validator writer, its frozen export, and one focused privacy/integrity test.
- Luna and Sol independently ran operations/production/Meetup/runner/evidence/Harness at 160/160 PASS. Syntax, diff, clean/upstream checks passed.
- Fresh Sol review returned `ship`, Critical 0 / Important 0. It confirmed the existing production hook consumes the method, invalid counts append nothing, file mode is 0600, persisted keys are aggregate-only, and other providers/report/action are unchanged.
- Reviewed code is fast-forwarded and pushed on the stable branch. Live acceptance remains one schedule-unloaded official wake.
- Official wake `wake-1cf5b5ef7ea3d42a3e4f78c4` persisted the exact `14/12/12/1/0` Meetup row, mode 0600, in the same lineage as positive every-wake Telegram ID `11496`. Candidate/effect/bundle deltas were zero because the only strict candidate has a real Calendar conflict. Process and Connector target intersection returned to zero. Live audit acceptance passes.
