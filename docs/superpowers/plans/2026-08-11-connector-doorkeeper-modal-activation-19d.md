# Connector Doorkeeper modal activation 19D Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development and test-driven-development. Luna writes production/tests; Sol reviews and verifies.

**Goal:** Browser Harnessがdefault inspectorのexact Doorkeeper modal triggerを一度だけclickし、required Email fillと最終submitへ同じpage上で進めるようにする。

**Architecture:** reviewed inspectorが返すunique exact trigger `kind: link`をDoorkeeperだけparent-authorized actionとして扱う。既存adapterのmutation dedupeを再利用し、modal trigger signatureとfinal form-submit signatureを明確に分離する。final submitはB4aのexact identity/readback latchをそのまま使う。

**Tech Stack:** Node.js CommonJS、`node:test`、既存Browser Harness adapter/control operator。

## Global Constraints

- 変更は`apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-production-browser-harness.js`とmatching testの2 filesだけ。production約20〜40 LOC、test約40〜80 LOC。
- trigger actionはprovider exact `doorkeeper`、valid candidate binding、current URL exact candidate canonical、one control `kind: link`, label exact `申し込む`, submittable false、observation内同条件count 1だけ。
- triggerは既存`ax_click`を使うが外部registration submitではない。signatureはmodal trigger固有で、final `form-submit`と衝突させない。
- same page/pathでtriggerの成功mutationは一度だけ。再選択はDOM action 0。final submit guard/max1と30秒registered-only readbackは維持する。
- arbitrary link、wrong provider/identity/label、duplicate trigger、button pretending triggerはaction 0。
- full injected flowはtrigger click 1、Email fill 1、final submit click 1、registered readbackでcompleted。trigger click後のabsent/unavailableは成功扱いにせず次stepへ進む。
- default inspector、private resolver、factory/router/workflow/native/operations/runner/evidence/schedule/live stateは変更しない。
- official wake 0、4 labels UNLOADED。

### Task 1: Activate the exact modal trigger without consuming final submit

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-production-browser-harness.js`
- Modify: `apps/rockstar_ibot/lib/connector-production-browser-harness.test.js`

- [x] **Step 1: Write RED action-flow tests**

  With injected observations and parent-owned values, prove:

  1. three-step exact flow: trigger link → required Email fill → single final button; repaired actions preserve all three in order and final state is registered;
  2. trigger and final submit each click exactly once and do not collide in mutation dedupe;
  3. selecting the same successful trigger twice produces no second DOM click, then a valid fill/final submit can still finish within the bounded steps;
  4. arbitrary/wrong-provider/wrong-identity/wrong-label/duplicate trigger/action token fails before link action;
  5. final submit ambiguity remains `effect_unknown` with no retry.

- [x] **Step 2: Run RED**

  ```bash
  cd apps/rockstar_ibot
  node --test lib/connector-production-browser-harness.test.js
  ```

- [x] **Step 3: Implement minimal trigger authorization/signature**

  Add a small exact trigger predicate reused by outer `performAction` and adapter signature/latch classification. Do not broaden generic link behavior. Keep final submit identification based on the actual observed button, not merely action purpose.

- [x] **Step 4: Run GREEN and adjacent checks**

  ```bash
  cd apps/rockstar_ibot
  node --test lib/connector-production-browser-harness.test.js
  node --test lib/connector-browser-harness-adapter.test.js lib/connector-doorkeeper-workflow.test.js lib/connector-minimal-production.test.js
  node --check lib/connector-production-browser-harness.js
  git diff --check
  ```

- [x] **Step 5: Self-review and commit**

  Verify exact 2-file ownership, generic links unchanged, trigger/final signatures distinct, Submit max1, no factory/native/live effect. Commit without amend and push.

## Plan Self-Review

- Ponytail: no new action engine; one exact predicate and existing dedupe/latch only.
- Scope: modal activation only. Production factory injection remains B4c.
- Safety: no official wake runs and no real provider submit occurs in tests.

## Result

Luna implemented exact Doorkeeper modal-trigger authorization, a distinct modal-trigger mutation signature/latch, and the default proposer path in the two assigned Harness files. The final regression set proves exact trigger → Email fill → one final submit, repeated-trigger action 0, default-proposer selection, semantic duplicate rejection even with an invalid token, and continued generic-link rejection.

Fresh Sol review first found that the default proposer omitted the closed-modal link; Luna reproduced that as RED and fixed it in `2229bb9b6`. The next fresh review found that token-strict duplicate counting weakened ambiguity handling; Luna split strict selection from token-independent semantic duplicate counting in `1b35d4a2f`. Final fresh review returned SHIP. An unrelated queued path-change experiment (`bc043cb2c`) was explicitly reverted by `cd82201dd`; the final tree is byte-identical to the reviewed `1b35d4a2f` tree.

Sol independently verified Harness `72/72`, adjacent adapter/workflow/factory `33/33`, syntax, diff checks, clean worktree, remote equality, and absence of the rejected experiment symbols/tests. No official wake, browser action, provider submit, Calendar write, Telegram send, or launchd load occurred. B4c production factory injection remains the next slice.
