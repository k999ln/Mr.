# JOB-BUDGET-HARD-CAP-10J: Conservative Pre-Spend Admission

**Goal:** Prevent the observed job-search daily loop from launching a provider
when the remaining daily allowance cannot cover that pass's configured maximum.

**Root cause:** The live run entered with 231,212 of 262,144 tokens consumed.
`browser-lane-agent.token_reservation` was only 24,576, so admission allowed
231,212 + 24,576. The provider later reported 93,420 chargeable tokens, and
settlement truthfully replaced the estimate, producing 324,632 consumed. The
ledger's arithmetic was correct; the caller passed an estimate that was not an
upper bound.

**Single hypothesis:** For a budget-enabled provider attempt, reserve the whole
configured per-pass limit before launch. Because the observed provider charge
93,420 was below the 98,304 pass limit, this makes the same live state fail
closed before a paid process starts. The smaller task-class reservation remains
only an unbudgeted planning estimate.

Firecrawl search was attempted with three independent English/Japanese queries,
but the agent-owned token returned HTTP 401. GitHub code search, the live
production receipt, and the public Stripe reference supplied the fallback
evidence; no personal account was used.

## TDD execution

- [x] Add a RED subprocess test with 70/100 daily tokens consumed, a 20-token
  task estimate, and a 100-token pass limit; prove the current runner launches
  the paid-provider stub.
- [x] Make budget-enabled admission reserve the 100-token pass maximum; prove
  exit 75, `attempt_count=0`, daily-budget reason, and no provider marker.
- [x] Preserve actual-token settlement and all crash/fallback accounting tests.
- [x] Run all 168 job-loop and 10 agent-runner tests plus OSS verification.
- [x] Update the design spec, push, pass all GitHub checks, merge, sync the
  canonical checkout, and kick the existing daily LaunchAgent.
- [x] Prove the post-merge live pass blocks before provider launch and leaves
  the usage ledger unchanged apart from one blocked reservation receipt.

## Closeout

PR #1350 merged as `e3bc44685` after all six checks in CI run
`30462362148` passed. The post-merge daily LaunchAgent advanced from run 10 to
11 and exited 0. Its durable summary records `budget_blocked`,
`attempt_count=0`, no selected provider or model, and a 98,304-token blocked
reservation against 324,632 tokens already consumed. The evidence directory
contains no attempt, stdout, stderr, result, or settlement artifact. The budget
ledger grew by exactly one blocked reservation row and application counts
remained 2 submitted / 1 submit-unknown / 2 not-submitted.
