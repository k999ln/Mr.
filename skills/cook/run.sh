# cook/run.sh — the EXPLORE earner: search the web for a NEW way to earn, surface candidates, and
# (when the model decides) share the find to the colony forum so peers can try it too.
#
# HARD RULE #0: this is a TOOL, not a decision. cook does NOT decide WHAT to build or WHETHER a lead is
# good — it brings the model fresh, real candidates (with URLs) and the model decides. Pattern copied
# from vinid/einstein-arena (explore → try → share-numbers) + BlockRunAI/Franklin (the model judges from
# real context, no hardcoded seed list). NOTHING hardcoded: the search query comes from $ANICCA_ARGS
# (the model's curiosity this wake) or a small rotating default; we do not pin specific repos/links.
#
# Env: ANICCA_ARGS (JSON, optional) — {"query":"<what to look for>"}; WAKE_ID.
# Output: records ONE narrate line to the earn ledger (source=cook) + prints the candidates as JSON so
# the model sees them next wake. Never spends money, never bricks.
