// economy/gig/lib/lock.mjs — per-resource file lock so concurrent calls that mutate the SAME gig (or
// the shared nextId counter, or the shared board file) cannot race past each other. Fixes a real
// double-pay drain an adversary found live: two concurrent gig_verify_and_pay(true) calls both read
// status 'delivered' before either wrote back, both settled a REAL on-chain payout, and the JSON
// ledger only recorded one (last-write-wins) -- the escrow was drained twice for a single gig. This
// lock makes "load -> decide -> network settle -> save" an exclusive critical section per lock key: a
// caller that can't acquire the lock is rejected immediately (fail-closed), never queued -- so at most
// one call ever reaches a real settle.
//
// Implementation: POSIX exclusive file creation (`wx` = O_CREAT|O_EXCL) is atomic even across separate
// OS processes on the same filesystem -- this protects against both same-process (Promise.all) races
// AND two separate `node scripts/...` invocations racing, which is the scenario the adversary actually
// hit (two concurrent verify_and_pay calls, real tx 0xd0af29c3 + 0x6573886b, both paid).
//
// ROUND-3 FIX (a second adversary pass, 2026-07-07): STALE_MS alone let a second caller STEAL a lock
// after 30s even from a holder that was still genuinely (legitimately) working -- a real settle+retry
// sequence measured at 16.79s plus network/confirmation on top can exceed 30s under congestion,
// reopening the double-pay race the lock exists to close. FIX: the holder now HEARTBEATS its own
// lock's mtime every `heartbeatMs` while `fn()` runs, so a LIVE holder's lock never looks stale to
// anyone else -- staleness now only ever indicates a genuinely dead (crashed) holder, never a merely
// slow one. `staleMs`/`heartbeatMs` are injectable (tests use tiny values; production uses generous
// defaults with a wide safety margin between the two).
//
// anicca-agent-economy REQ-101 (Phase 2b, GREEN): the staleness decision is a pure predicate --
// `isLockStale(nowMs, mtimeMs, staleMs)` -- extracted out of acquire() and independently exported (was
// previously inlined as `Date.now() - stat.mtimeMs > staleMs`). REQ-101 also closes a real reclaim race
// the Phase 2a RED evidence surfaced: the OLD stale-reclaim branch did `fs.unlink(file)` then
// `fs.open(file, "wx")`, and `unlink` is not scoped to "the file I just observed" -- a second racer's
// `unlink` could delete the FIRST racer's freshly-recreated lock file, letting both racers'
// `fs.open("wx")` calls each succeed in turn (both believing they hold the lock). FIX: reclaim now goes
// through `fs.rename(file, <unique trash path>)` instead of `fs.unlink`. POSIX rename() REQUIRES its
// source path to exist and is atomic with respect to concurrent renames of the same source -- when two
// racers reach this line concurrently, exactly ONE rename can succeed (it atomically removes `file` from
// that path); the other racer's rename call fails with ENOENT because the winner already moved it away.
// This makes the reclaim step itself atomic (no unlink-then-recreate window), matching REQ-101's binding
// acceptance criterion ("Reclaim uses an atomic filesystem primitive ... never a check-then-act pair").

// SEC-1 fix (Phase 5 security-report.md, path traversal via unsanitized gigId/lockKey): lockPaths()
// below builds a real filesystem path by string-interpolating `lockKey` directly into a filename
// (`${lockKey}.lock`) and joining it onto the locks/ directory. `path.join` COLLAPSES ".." segments
// instead of rejecting them, so an unsanitized lockKey (a caller-supplied gigId, in production) such as
// "../../../../../../../../../../tmp/anicca-poc-escaped-file-live" resolves OUTSIDE the intended
// <statePath-dir>/locks/ directory entirely -- a live PoC this session created (and, via
// reclaimStaleLock's rename/unlink path, could touch) a file at that escaped location while the lock
// was "held" (see security-report.md SEC-1). The PRIMARY fix is mcp-server.mjs's zod schema constraining
// gigId's character set before it ever reaches here (same commit); THIS is the SECOND, independent
// layer, so any caller of withGigLock -- gigId, "_post", "_board", or a future lock key -- is protected
// even if some future caller forgets the schema-level guard or calls gig.mjs's exported functions
// directly (bypassing mcp-server.mjs entirely, which any Node script importing gig.mjs already can).
