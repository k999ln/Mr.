// economy/gig/mcp-server.mjs — MCP stdio server exposing the P2.2 gig board as ordinary Franklin tools.
// SPEC.md §9.1: Franklin's own MCP loader (@blockrun/franklin, dist/mcp/config.js) reads
// ~/.blockrun/mcp.json's "mcpServers" map at startup and wraps any listed stdio server into its normal
// tool set -- Franklin itself is never touched, we only ADD a server entry (wiring snippet in README,
// NOT applied to the live file here -- that's the witness step the team lead runs separately).
//
// Each tool call takes the CALLING agent's own private key as an argument (never stored by this
// process beyond the single call) -- the gig board holds no custody over poster/taker wallets, only
// over its own escrow keypair (GIG_ESCROW_PRIVATE_KEY, see README "Escrow model").

// SEC-1 fix (Phase 5 security-report.md, path traversal via unsanitized gigId): gigId flows straight
// into lib/lock.mjs's withGigLock(statePath, gigId, ...) as a filesystem lock-file-name fragment
// (`${lockKey}.lock`, path.join'd onto <statePath-dir>/locks/) BEFORE the gig even exists is checked --
// an unconstrained `z.string()` let a crafted gigId like
// "../../../../../../../../../../tmp/anicca-poc-escaped-file-live" collapse path.join's traversal
// segments and create (and, via reclaimStaleLock's rename/unlink, potentially touch) a file OUTSIDE the
// intended locks/ directory (live-verified PoC, see security-report.md SEC-1). gigId is always generated
// by lib/store.mjs's applyPost as `String(state.nextId)` (a plain positive-integer counter, see
// store.mjs) -- this pattern also matches lib/lock.mjs's own internal lock keys ("_post", "_board"), so
// a safe identifier charset (letters/digits/underscore/hyphen only -- no "/", ".", or other path
// separators) is both correct for every real gigId and generous enough for future non-numeric ids.
// This is the PRIMARY defense layer; lib/lock.mjs's own isSafeLockKey/withGigLock check (SEC-1 fix,
// same commit) is the second, independent layer for any caller that bypasses this MCP schema.
