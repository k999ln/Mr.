# key_health_gate.sh — FAIL-CLOSED pre-publish gate for the Capafy host LLM key.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-18, A1 root-cause):
#   Capafy rejected 4 run_online agents with "FailoverError ... billing error
#   (OpenRouter key 残高不足)" on the review smoke-test. Root cause was NOT a stale
#   key and NOT the provider-name label — it was a thin OpenRouter balance.
#   Publishing into an under-funded account
#   guarantees a re-reject. This gate stops the loop BEFORE it wastes a publish.
#
# It does two REAL checks against OpenRouter (no dry-run):
#   1. GET /credits  -> remaining = total_credits - total_usage  (must be >= threshold)
#   2. POST /chat/completions anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6 max_tokens=5 -> must return 200 + content
# NEVER prints the key. Exits 0 = healthy (publish may proceed), 1 = block (fail-closed).
#
# Usage: key_health_gate.sh [min_remaining_usd]   (default 2.00)
#
# FUNDING ALERT (#21, 2026-07-19): the gate is fail-closed but was SILENT — when the balance
# ran low the loop just stopped publishing and user never knew a top-up was needed. This gate now
# telegram-alerts user (a) as an EARLY WARNING while it still passes but is within a cushion of the
# block threshold, and (b) when it actually blocks on balance. It NEVER auto-charges — funding the
# OpenRouter card is user's decision (money out = irreversible = user gate). Alerts are deduped to
# at-most-once-per-calendar-day so a daily loop can't spam. Never prints the key.
