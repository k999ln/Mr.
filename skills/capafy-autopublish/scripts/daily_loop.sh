# HEALTHY-PASS MARKER (self-fix-capafy-loop, 2026-07-08): touched whenever the loop reaches a
# HEALTHY terminal state — either it published something OR it correctly determined there is
# nothing to publish (inventory drained / cap full). The healthcheck watches THIS file's mtime,
# not published.jsonl. Why: this loop DRAINS a finite hand-built inventory; once every listing
# is online, published.jsonl can never grow, so the old "grew in 30h?" alarm false-escalated an
# Opus self-fix forever for a non-bug. This marker stays fresh while the loop is healthy-idle,
# and only goes stale if the loop stops running OR keeps hitting a real BLOCKED publish — which
# is exactly when a self-fix SHOULD fire.
