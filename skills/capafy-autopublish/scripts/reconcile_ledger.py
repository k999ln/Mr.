reconcile_ledger.py — make state/published.jsonl mirror the Capafy SERVER truth.

WHY THIS EXISTS (self-fix-capafy-loop, 2026-07-07):
  The daily loop's health signal is `state/published.jsonl` (the healthcheck escalates a
  self-fix when it stops growing for 30h). But the ledger was a LOCAL append-only log that
  silently drifted from the server:
    - agents that actually went ONLINE (e.g. O1 Japanese Humanizer 6501274812, O2 Academic
      Humanizer 7883384570 — both status=4 listed) were never appended → ledger looked stale
      → false-positive 30h escalation, even though the pipeline had really published them;
    - an agent recorded as "submitted status=1" (O9 YouTube 7686597754) was actually
      REVIEW_REJECTED on the server (status=2/auditStatus=3) → the loop kept treating a dead
      item as done and never retried it.
  Dual source-of-truth (local ledger vs server) is the real defect. The server is the ONLY
  truth. This tool reconciles the ledger against `publish-list` every run, so:
    - the ledger grows the moment the server has a newly-online agent (health signal recovers
      and stays truthful),
    - review_rejected items surface as work-to-retry instead of silently "done".

  It NEVER invents a publish: it only records agents the SERVER reports as online, and only
  flags (does not fabricate) rejected ones. Idempotent + atomic.

Usage:
  reconcile_ledger.py            # reconcile, print a summary, exit 0
  reconcile_ledger.py --json     # also print a machine-readable summary line (RECONCILE_JSON=...)
Exit 0 always (reconciliation is best-effort; a server read failure is reported, not fatal).
