# Developer Skill API Contract

## 1. Scope

This document describes the seller-side capability surface that the current Developer Skill runtime can rely on. With the seller-side integrated backend documentation and the current runtime code as the source of truth, the current runtime uses the **12 `/agent/**` query/handling endpoints**, **1 account info endpoint**, and **2 login CLI entry points** consolidated here.

`api-docs/index.json` only keeps the version number and runtime entry declarations; interface details are governed by this document.

## 2. Base conventions

### 2.1 Base address

```
https://api.capafy.ai
```

### 2.2 Authentication

- Login only goes through `login-init` / `login-verify` / `login-token`; the underlying auth requests are wrapped by the CLI. `login-token` must first call `/agent/account` to validate the supplied token, and may only persist after validation passes; the runtime does not directly call other authentication endpoint paths.
- Before email OTP login, the host must first do the compliance consent gate: take the current platform base URL, strip a trailing `/api` to derive the web base, present `{web_base}/terms-of-service` and `{web_base}/privacy-policy` to the creator, and require explicit consent to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Vague replies (such as "ok", "go", "continue", "next") do not count as explicit consent; `login-init` must not be run before explicit consent. `CAPAFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, the local `config.json`, or `login-token` use the authentication path after the token has already been issued, and do not repeat the consent prompt.
- `/agent/**` endpoints require an Access Token; one of the following two request headers may be used:

  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}
  ```
  ```http
  X-Access-Token: {accessToken}
  ```

- Token source priority: `CAPAFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable > local `config.json`.
- Publish orchestration and the platform adapter layer automatically read in this priority; no manual parameter passing is needed.
- **When the user directly pastes a token in the conversation, or requests switching the platform account / user**: run `login-token`. The command first calls `/agent/account` with the token, and only writes to the local `config.json` (the file under the capafy-publisher root) — as the new local fallback account — when a valid account object is returned; 401, network failure, non-JSON, business error codes, or non-object responses are all treated as failure. On failure, the local `config.json` must not be written or overwritten; the command output and error output must not echo the token. The user skill's account file is not touched here; the user skill has its own switching logic.

### 2.3 Unified response structure

All business endpoints uniformly return `R<T>`:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "ok",
  "data": {}
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | int | Business code; `0` indicates success |
| `msg` | string | Response message |
| `data` | object / array / null | Business data |

### 2.4 Common data formats

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Date | Common format is `yyyy-MM-dd` |
| Timestamp | Most time fields are Unix millisecond timestamps |
| ISO time | A few authentication-related fields use ISO-8601 strings |
| Amount | Amount fields in the document are usually displayed in USD. |

### 2.5 Web confirmation page mandatory rule

Every `url` field returned by a platform endpoint is a **mandatory human web confirmation step**:

- The returned URL already carries a temporary `draftKey` / temporary token; the caller **jumps directly** without appending parameters itself
- After obtaining the URL, the host **must pause**, waiting for the creator in person to complete confirmation on the web
- Once confirmation is complete, continue running the next stage of publish orchestration; the orchestration internally reads back the current source of truth
- Chat confirmation, local helper script output, scripts submitting the web form on behalf of the user, and reverse-engineering the web endpoint are **not equivalent substitutes**

This is an "axiomatic" rule; it is not repeated below — only "the returned `url` is a web confirmation step (see §2.5)" is mentioned.

## 3. Version update

- Before reading this directory, you should first run `python3 self_update.py --check` to check the version.
- Supports Python >= 3.8; Python 3.11+ uses the standard library `tomllib`, 3.8-3.10 use the built-in TOML fallback shipped with the Skill.
- `self_update.py` currently determines the latest version via a remote install manifest and downloads the zip install package using the `downloadUrl` returned by the manifest.
- The install manifest must carry the zip digest as `sha256`; `self_update.py` verifies the downloaded zip before extracting.
- When the update bundle carries `requirements.txt`, `self_update.py` installs those Python dependencies after completing the zip update; otherwise dependency installation is skipped.
- Windows install mode first copies the updater to the system temp directory and then has an external runner replace the formal skill directory, avoiding the running `self_update.py` locking its own directory.
- Because the release package does not install Python dependencies, PEP 668 / externally-managed-environment should not block self-update.
- The current local version is read preferentially from `.temp/self-update-state.json`; only if no install state file exists yet does it fall back to the `version` in `api-docs/index.json`.
- If `self_update.py --check` returns `check_failed`, continue using the current local version and report the check failure as a notice; do not block the runtime.
- If a later real platform response header carries `X-Skill-Version-Status: outdated` or `deprecated`, the normalized platform response should carry `skill_version_status`; the host should remind the creator whether to update at the next human confirmation point.

## 4. Runtime notes

- The auth entry points are `login-init` / `login-verify` / `login-token`; the publish main-chain entry points are `publish-init` / `publish-configure` / `publish-ship` / `publish-status`. `publish-init` must be passed `--env <env_id>` and `--runtime-dir <absolute_path>`; when a single local skill source directory is specified, additionally pass `--skill-dir <single_skill_dir>`.
- `login-init` may only run after the creator has explicitly consented to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy; the compliance consent gate only covers email OTP login, not existing token login.
- `--env` is the target runtime; if the subject being published is a `metadata.openclaw` skill, `openclaw` must be passed.
- `--runtime-dir` is the project root / workspace root opened in the host session; do not pass the user home, the publisher skill root, the directory of the skill being published itself, or the parent `skills` directory. Claude Code / Codex passes the current session's project root; OpenClaw passes the current OpenClaw workspace.
- `--skill-dir` is the optional single source directory of the skill being published; it must contain `SKILL.md`; it does not change the semantics of `--runtime-dir`, and cannot be the parent `skills` directory.
- When `publish-init` submits selections, it is recommended to use `--selections-file .temp/confirmed-selections.json` to avoid multi-line JSON being damaged by shell quoting. Selections must be top-level `{ "title", "description", "skills", "plugins", "crons" }`; when updating an existing Agent, also add top-level `agent_id`; do not wrap inside `selection_groups`, and do not pass `workflow_intent`.
- `publish-configure` only accepts a dispositions file path via `--dispositions-file <dispositions.json>` when buyout mode needs the creator to choose how to handle sensitive items; do not pass inline JSON.
- Copyable command form: `python3 packager.py publish-init --env codex --runtime-dir /home/admin_wsl/sunnet/project/agent_store --skill-dir /home/admin_wsl/.agents/skills/skill-vetter --selections-file .temp/confirmed-selections.json`. Example paths must be replaced with the actual paths on the local machine.
- `publish-init` first verifies platform login state; if not logged in or the token has expired, it returns `platform_login_required` / `platform_login_invalid` and does not continue local candidate discovery or submission.
- The CLI additionally handles: token persistence, publish working state, upload, reporting, remote latest-version status, Agent listing, and refreshing an expired review URL.
- When troubleshooting, first check the local working state from `publish-status`; the login state only keeps two sources — the environment variable and the current skill's `config.json`.
- `login-token --access-token <token>` is used to change the local fallback token / local platform account; what is written here is the `config.json` under the `capafy-publisher` root directory. It is not a blind write: the command first calls `/agent/account`, and only persists the token and the available account fields (`user_id` / `email` / `name`) after confirming the token is usable. If the current process still sets `CAPAFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, the runtime will continue to prefer the account in the environment variable.
- When `/agent/*` returns `401`, guide the creator to rerun `login-init` + `login-verify`, or provide a new token and run `login-token`; do not retry automatically.
- Endpoints without CLI wrapping are recommended to be called via `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` (after login, `base_url` and token are injected automatically; no manual parameter passing is needed); statistics, payouts, certification, and refunds are currently called directly on demand.
- `GET /agent/account` is used to verify whether the token supplied to `login-token` is still valid and to read back current account info; it belongs to the account info endpoints, not the publish main chain. The endpoint may return the platform standard `R<T>` response, or a bare account object; the runtime uniformly takes the account object.
- All `url` values returned by the platform are mandatory human web confirmation steps; see §2.5. If an existing `review_url` expires, call `publish-refresh-url --agent-id <agent_id> [--step init|configure|ship]`; this wraps `GET /agent/agents/{agentId}/editLink` and returns a fresh web confirmation URL for the latest editable version without rerunning the publish step.
- `module_index` is the authoritative directory of the current runtime:
  - Modules with `runtime_active=true` belong to the current runtime input set
  - Modules with `runtime_active=false` are only maintainer context and should not be treated as a runtime contract

## 5. Error code summary

This table is the **single source of truth** for all error codes. Interfaces return based on `code` in the unified response body; the response does not contain backend enum names; the "symbolic name" below is only an internal backend codename.

| Scenario | Common `code` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Access Token not provided or invalid | `401` | Unauthorized or Access Token invalid |
| `agentId` does not exist or does not belong to the current seller | `2004` | Agent does not exist, or the current seller has no permission to operate |
| Current version status does not permit this operation | `2019` | E.g., still trying to write publish artifacts when not in editable state `(0, 2)` |
| Query date format error | `400` | Request parameter error |
| Query date range exceeds 90 days | `2021` | Query time range exceeds 90 days |
| Refund ticket does not exist or does not belong to the current seller | `4012` | Refund ticket does not exist, or the current seller has no permission to operate |
| Refund status does not allow current operation | `4013` | Current refund status does not allow this operation |
| Developer refund response has timed out | `4014` | Developer refund response invalid or timed out |
| Developer certification re-initiated | `4037` | Developer certification already completed |

## 6. Entry and endpoint index (15 items)

> Numbers S12, S13 are still reserved for the pricing module that has not yet been activated; new endpoints use S23 to avoid renumbering existing entries.

### 6.1 Login CLI and account info (3)

| # | Calling method | Handling method | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| S01 | `login-init` | CLI internal wrapper | Send login verification code |
| S02 | `login-verify` | CLI internal wrapper | Verify OTP and obtain accessToken |
| S05 | `GET /agent/account` | Internal wrapper of `login-token` | Validate the supplied token and read back account info (account info endpoint; not part of the publish main chain) |

`login-token` first calls `/agent/account` (S05) to verify the token, then persists the verified token to the local `config.json` (the file under the capafy-publisher root) to refresh or switch the local fallback account. On failure, the local `config.json` must remain unchanged.

Handling details:

- A successful response accepts either `{ "code": 0, "data": { ... } }` or directly returns `{ "email": "...", ... }`.
- `data: null` may be treated as an empty account object, but HTTP 401, HTTP 4xx/5xx, non-JSON, non-object, and `code != 0` are all failures.
- Written fields only include local login info needed, e.g., `access_token`, `user_id`, `email`, `name`; the CLI response must not contain `access_token`.

Common S05 account fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `userId` / `user_id` | string/null | Platform user ID; different response shapes may use different naming. |
| `email` | string/null | Email of the current platform account. |
| `name` | string/null | Display name of the current platform account. |
| `status` | string/null | User status; a valid token usually corresponds to a usable account. |
| `developerVerified` | boolean/int/null | Developer certification status; only used for display and flow prompts, does not replace the KYC query endpoint. |
| `accessToken` | string/null | Login verify response may return; `login-token` validation output must not echo it. |

### 6.2 Agent queries and lifecycle gaps (3)

| # | Calling path | Corresponding endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| S03 | Internal adapter layer / host platform capability | `GET /agent/agents` | Seller Agent list |
| S04 | Internal readback inside `publish-*` orchestration | `GET /agent/agents/{agentId}` | Latest version details of an Agent |
| S23 | `publish-refresh-url --agent-id <agent_id> [--step init|configure|ship]` | `GET /agent/agents/{agentId}/editLink` | Refresh a human web confirmation URL for the latest editable version; does not rerun init/configure/ship |

#### Common enumerations

| Enumeration | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agentType` | `run_online` | Hosted-type Agent product, corresponds to local `distribution_mode=cloud_hosted` |
| `agentType` | `download` | Download-type / buyout Skill product, corresponds to local `distribution_mode=buyout` |
| `bizType` | `run_online` / `download` | Business type for file uploads etc.; stays consistent with the current version's `agentType` |
| `agentStatus` | `draft` / `under_review` / `review_rejected` / `online` / `offline` / `banned` | List view status |
| `status` | `0` / `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` / `5` / `6` | The overall agent lifecycle status of the **latest version**: draft, under review, review rejected, review passed/pending listing, listed, expired, delisted. `0` = draft (not submitted); do not misread as "submitted / processing" |
| `auditStatus` | `0` / `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` | Review sub-status of the **latest version** (only meaningful when `status` is in the review-flow segment): review not started, auto-review in progress, manual review in progress, review failed, review passed. `0` = review not started; not "pending review / under review" |
| `agentRuntime` | `openclaw` / `codex` / `opencode` / `claude` | Runtime identifier returned by the platform; this skill currently only maps `claude` / `codex` / `openclaw` to local runtimes |

`status in (0, 2)` is the baseline gate for subsequent publish write operations; the specific next step is determined by the JSON payload returned by `publish-*` commands.

#### `GET /agent/agents`

Use:

- Lets the host decide whether this round is creating a new listing or updating an existing one

Stability notes:

- If the platform still returns extra fields, treat them as best-effort additional info inside `raw_data`, not a stable minimum contract.
- The backend source of truth for billing fields is `billings[]`; type determination for the publish main chain only reads `agentType`.
- Confirmed skill selection is based on `workflowInfo.selection_groups`; the raw top-level `selectionGroups` may be empty or missing and is not the basis for confirmation. Runtime code normalizes to top-level `selection_groups` via `get_latest_version()`.

#### `GET /agent/agents/{agentId}/editLink`

Use:

- Refresh an expired human web confirmation URL for the latest editable version
- Resume a paused confirmation step without rerunning `publish-init`, `publish-configure`, or `publish-ship`

Returned `url` is still a mandatory creator web confirmation step; see §2.5. If the latest version is not editable, the endpoint fails instead of creating a new version.

#### Lifecycle gaps

The public main chain only exposes `publish-init` / `publish-configure` / `publish-ship`. Underlying write endpoints are used internally by the orchestration and are not expanded as runtime documentation entry points.

| Operation | Current runtime handling |
|---|---|
| Create new listing | Go through the `publish-init --env <env_id> --runtime-dir <absolute_path> --selections` create path; for an explicit single local skill source, additionally carry `--skill-dir` |
| Version update | Go through the `publish-init --env <env_id> --runtime-dir <absolute_path> --selections` update path with non-empty `agent_id`; for an explicit single local skill source, additionally carry `--skill-dir` |
| Save credentials | Go through `publish-configure`, only `cloud_hosted` |
| Upload and report package | Go through `publish-ship` |
| relist / delist / delete-draft | Pure status actions have no API; the current shipped runtime does not support them |

There is currently no standalone endpoint to rescan the project root within a version; when rescanning is needed, go through the `publish-init` update branch and pass `runtime_dir` again, and if the published subject comes from a separate source directory, pass the same `--skill-dir` again. The next step of the publish pipeline is determined by the JSON payload returned by `publish-configure` / `publish-ship`.

### 6.3 Developer queries (9)

These endpoints currently have no dedicated `packager.py` subcommand; recommended to call directly via `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli`. After login, `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` automatically resolves `base_url` from the environment variable, explicit arguments, or default values, and reads `access_token` from `config.json`; only the API path needs to be provided:

```bash
python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli GET "/agent/sales/trend?startDate=2026-04-20&endDate=2026-04-27"
python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli POST "/agent/refund/developer/response" --json '{"refundId":"...","developerResponseCode":"other","developerResponse":"..."}'
```

| # | Calling method | Corresponding endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| S16 | `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` direct call | `GET /agent/developer/payout-record` | Payout records |

| S15 | `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` direct call | `GET /agent/agent/{agentId}/stats` | Single Agent business performance |
| S18 | `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` direct call | `GET /agent/refund/developer/list` | Refund list |
| S19 | `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` direct call | `GET /agent/refund/developer/{refundId}/detail` | Refund details |
| S20 | `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` direct call | `POST /agent/refund/developer/response` | Respond to refund |
| S21 | `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` direct call | `POST /agent/developer/cert/start` | Start certification |
| S22 | `python3 -m capafy_platform.http_cli` direct call | `GET /agent/developer/cert` | Certification details |

#### Earnings and payouts

`GET /agent/developer/payout-info` queries payout method, wallet balance, and payout info.

`GET /agent/developer/payout-info` return fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `payoutMethod` | string/null | Payout method, e.g., `wire_transfer`; `null` when not configured. |
| `currency` | string | Wallet currency; currently usually `usd`. |
| `balancePending` | number | Pending settlement balance, unit USD. |
| `balanceConfirmed` | number | Confirmed balance, unit USD. |
| `balancePayout` | number | Pending payout balance, unit USD. |
| `totalPayout` | number | Cumulative paid-out amount, unit USD. |
| `accountNumber` | string/null | Masked bank account display value, e.g., `****2020`. |

`GET /agent/developer/payout-record` queries the most recent 5 payout records.

`GET /agent/developer/payout-record` return fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `payoutRecordId` | string | Payout record ID. |
| `payoutMonth` | string | Billing period month, usually `yyyy-MM`. |
| `payoutMethod` | string/null | Payout method, e.g., `wire_transfer`. |
| `status` | string | Payout status: `pending` / `paid`. |
| `amount` | number | Payout amount, unit USD. |
| `currency` | string | Payout record currency; historical empty values are compatible as `usd`. |
| `operatorId` | string/null | Platform operator ID. |
| `paymentReference` | string/null | Payout voucher number / transaction number. |

| `paidAt` | long/null | Actual payout time, Unix millisecond timestamp. |
| `createdAt` | long | Creation time, Unix millisecond timestamp. |
| `updatedAt` | long | Update time, Unix millisecond timestamp. |

Current gaps: no paginated payout record query API; payout method modification and verification require going through the web flow.

`POST /agent/refund/developer/response` submits the developer response. Request body fields: `refundId` required and at most 36 characters; `developerResponseCode` required; `developerResponse` required and at most 2000 characters; `developerResponseAttachments` optional and at most 5 links.

Developer refund response request body:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `refundId` | string | Yes | Refund ticket ID, at most 36 characters. |

| `developerResponse` | string | Yes | Developer reply description, at most 2000 characters. |
| `developerResponseAttachments` | array<string> | No | List of developer reply attachment links, at most 5. |

A successful response is the unified `R<T>`; currently `data` may be treated as `null`.

Business rules: only the `pending_developer_response` status can be responded to; must be submitted before `developerDeadlineAt`; after success the status enters `pending_arbitration`; the developer response is not the final arbitration.

#### KYC / Developer certification

`POST /agent/developer/cert/start` initiates or continues certification; the request body may be empty or `{}`. Returns `url`, which is a web confirmation step; the host must pause and wait for the creator to complete it. Specific error: `4037` means developer certification is already completed; cannot be re-initiated.

`POST /agent/developer/cert/start` return fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | Temporary link to the developer certification page; this is a mandatory web confirmation step, see §2.5. |

`GET /agent/developer/cert` queries certification status.

`GET /agent/developer/cert` return fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `paymentStatus` | string | Certification fee payment status; currently known values include `pending_payment`, `paid`, `payment_failed`, `refunded`. |
| `kycStatus` | string | KYC status; currently known values include `pending`, `submitted_pending_payment`, `reviewing`, `approved`, `rejected`. |
| `paymentMethod` | string/null | Current certification path, e.g., `wire_transfer`; may be `null` when not started. |

| `fee.amount` | number | Certification fee amount, unit USD. |
| `fee.status` | string | Certification fee status. |
| `fee.paidAt` | string/null | Payment success time, ISO-8601. |

The complete enumerations for `paymentStatus`, `fee.status`, and `kycStatus` are not yet fixed in the current platform documentation; the host should display them according to the actual return without making hard branch assumptions.
