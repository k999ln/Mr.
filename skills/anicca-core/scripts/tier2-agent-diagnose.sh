# tier2-agent-diagnose.sh — TIER 2 (agent-diagnosis) + F6 (model failover) + TIER 3
# (bounded single-Telegram escalation), spec 2026-07-01-openclaw-self-heal-design.md §3
# + §6.1 (2026-07-04 safety addendum).
#
# F6 (model/provider outage) IS a deterministic decision-table row (spec §3.2: probe =
# ping/lastError pattern, remediation = failover to a known-free model) — handled here
# rather than in tier1-remediate.sh because it needs `openclaw cron`/config access, not
# just log-file scanning.
#
# TIER 2 (genuinely unknown failures — anything NOT explained by F1-F6) is where
# building-effective-ai-agents.md's rule actually applies: the DIAGNOSIS is done by a
# real agent turn reading ground truth (error text, cron definition), not a hardcoded
# regex classifier guessing root cause. Only the DISPATCH decision ("is this F1-F6 or
# genuinely unknown") is deterministic string-matching — that's a machine-format
# classification (does this error contain 'Cannot find package'?), not open-ended
# judgment, and is explicitly allowed by the same rule ("regex is fine for genuine
# parsing of a fixed machine format... not judgment").
#
# ★ SAFETY (spec §6.1, added after discovering 70/200 real crons in error state, mostly
#   content-posting/distribution jobs like Larry/Comedy/Life-call): NEITHER F6 NOR
#   TIER 2 EVER force-fires a cron to "verify" a fix. `openclaw cron run` would actually
#   execute that cron's real payload — for a posting cron, that means a REAL post/send,
#   directly violating "never test by direct posting" (memory
#   feedback_never_test_by_direct_posting). Every fix here is verified by WAITING for
#   the cron's own next NATURALLY SCHEDULED fire and checking its result afterward, on a
#   LATER run of this same script — never forced early. ★
#
# TIER 2's diagnosis agent turn is prompted to be READ-ONLY-DIAGNOSIS-ONLY (may take a
# narrow, safe, infra-level action like a gateway restart; must NEVER execute the
# target cron's own task).
