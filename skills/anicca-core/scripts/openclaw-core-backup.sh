# `openclaw backup create` exists but is not usable here as a scheduled job: it
# defaults to the CURRENT directory (2026-07-27 it wrote a 12.8GB credentials archive
# into a git repo root, unignored), and even with --no-include-workspace it produced
# 11GB against 3.9Gi of free space -- ENOSPC on the next run. Measured, the whole of
# ~/.openclaw is 15G, but everything irreplaceable is 55M:
#
#   credentials/     4K    channel + pairing secrets
#   openclaw.json   28K    config AND auth.profiles (oauth/token identities)
#   cron/jobs.json  9.0M   316 scheduled jobs
#   identity/       56M    device identity
#   devices/        8.0K
#
# Sessions, agents and logs are the other 15G. Losing them costs history, not the
# ability to come back up, so they are deliberately out of scope.
