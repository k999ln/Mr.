# Nosana deploy executor (S1)

Franklin (an AI agent) rents its own GPU compute on Nosana and pays for it with **its own
Solana wallet** — zero human in the loop. This is S1 of the "agent financial independence" goal:
prove the payment rail works before building the self-renewing rent loop (S3) or externalizing
state (S4) on top of it.

## The two Nosana payment rails, and why only one is used here

Nosana supports two ways to pay for a job:

1. **Wallet rail (used here, the only rail this executor will ever use).** The poster signs and
   broadcasts a Solana transaction from their own keypair, paying NOS directly out of their own
   token account. This is real, self-custodied money leaving a wallet Franklin controls.
2. **Credits rail (`nosana job post --api <key>` / `NOSANA_API_KEY`) — forbidden here.** Nosana
   credits are purchased with a card via Stripe on nosana.io — i.e. a human funds the account.
   Paying with credits would make Franklin's "compute rent" a line item on someone's credit card,
   not an expense Franklin covers from its own economic activity. That defeats the entire point
   of this goal (financial independence with no human in the loop), so `deploy.mjs` actively
   **refuses** to use it: if `NOSANA_API_KEY` (or `NOS_API_KEY`) is present in the environment, it
   is logged as deliberately ignored and never passed to the CLI's `--api` flag.

Franklin's identity for this rail is resolved once, canonically, via
`skills/earn/lib/resolve-identity.mjs`'s `resolveSolanaSecret` — the exact same secret every other
earn/spend engine in this repo already uses (Franklin's home is `$HOME/.blockrun`, secret at
`$HOME/.blockrun/.solana-session`). `keypair.mjs` derives the `nosana` CLI's required 64-byte
JSON-array keypair file from that secret at runtime into
`$ANICCA_HOME/.automaton/nosana_key.json` (mode 0600, parent dir 0700) — it is never a new or
second wallet, and the secret is never logged.

## Commands

```bash
# Dry run (DEFAULT — never spends, never posts). Resolves identity, prices the cheapest live GPU
# market, builds+validates a job definition, and runs the balance+cap gate, then stops.
ANICCA_HOME=$HOME/.blockrun bin/citizen-up
ANICCA_HOME=$HOME/.blockrun bin/citizen-up --dry   # equivalent, explicit

# Live run — the ONLY way this ever actually spends NOS and posts on-chain.
ANICCA_HOME=$HOME/.blockrun bin/citizen-up --live

# Help
bin/citizen-up --help
```

Env overrides (all optional): `NOSANA_JOB_IMAGE`, `NOSANA_JOB_EXPOSE_PORT`,
`NOSANA_JOB_DURATION_MINUTES` (default 15), `NOSANA_MAX_SPEND_USD` (default `0.50`, the hard cap
on any single job's estimated cost), `NOSANA_RPC_URL` / `SOLANA_RPC_URL`, `NOSANA_NETWORK`
(default `mainnet`).

## Module map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `keypair.mjs` | Resolves Franklin's secret, derives its address, materializes the CLI keypair file. Never logs secret material. |
| `market.mjs` | Fetches the live Nosana market price list and NOS/USD price; pure `selectCheapestMarket` / `estimateJobCost`. Wires (but does not modify) `skills/self/spawn/lib/cloud-target.mjs`'s generic, deliberately-unwired `fetchNosUsdPrice`. |
| `job-definition.mjs` | Pure builder + structural validator for a schema-0.1 `container` job definition exposing one long-running service. |
| `spend-gate.mjs` | Pure money-safety gate: per-job/daily/cumulative USD caps (mirrors `skills/earn/funding/lib/caps.py`'s semantics) plus NOS/SOL balance sufficiency. |
| `deploy.mjs` | Orchestrates the above, shells out to the real `nosana` CLI, records settled cost to `shelter-cost-ledger.js`. |
| `bin/citizen-up` (repo root) | Thin CLI entrypoint — no business logic, just argv parsing and wiring real defaults into `deployNosanaJob`. |

## Money-safety notes

- **Fail closed everywhere.** A price-fetch failure, an unresolvable identity, or no eligible
  market all *throw* rather than silently proceeding with a zero/free assumption.
- **At-most-once.** A live run writes an intent record (`nosana-deploy-intents.jsonl` under
  `resolveStateDir()`) *before* posting, then reconciles the real outcome by reading job state via
  `nosana job list --poster <address> --market <market> --time-start <ts>` (verified against
  `@nosana/cli`'s own source: this indexer-backed command returns each job's real `address`,
  `state`, `market`, and `timeStart`). If the post's stdout can't be confidently parsed AND
  reconciliation can't confirm a job, the run throws `post-unknown` rather than retrying —
  a human (or a future S3 reconciliation pass) must resolve it by hand.
- **Cap unification is follow-up work, not done here.** `spend-gate.mjs` re-expresses
  `caps.py`'s per-transfer/daily/cumulative + tx-hash-dedupe semantics in JS because this
  executor is JS and `caps.py` is Python (shelling out to Python from here was explicitly ruled
  out). The two cap engines currently live side by side; merging them into one implementation
  shared across languages (e.g. a small spec both wrap, or moving the Nosana spend into the same
  ledger `caps.py` already reads) is real, valuable follow-up work, not attempted in S1.

## Known gap: unverified `nosana job post` JSON shape

This session never ran `--live` (by explicit instruction — a real post is a human call, not an
executor call). `nosana job post --format json`'s exact stdout shape for the posted job's address
was therefore never observed directly; reading `@nosana/cli`'s own source
(`dist/src/providers/utils/ouput-formatter/json/JsonOutputEventHandlers.js`) shows its JSON
formatter accumulates fields like `job_posting`/`service_url` but **never explicitly sets a plain
`response.job` address field** — so `deploy.mjs`'s `parseJobAddressFromPostOutput` is a
best-effort guess over a few plausible shapes, and is **never trusted alone**: every post is
followed by `reconcileNosanaJob`, which re-reads real state via `job list` (a call whose JSON
shape *was* verified directly from source — `dist/src/cli/job/list/action.js` prints
`JSON.stringify(jobs, null, 2)` where each `job` has `.address`/`.state`/`.market`/`.timeStart`).
If the very first real `--live` run's stdout doesn't match any of the guessed shapes, the
reconciliation step is what actually finds the job — this is the highest-risk unverified
assumption in this deliverable (see the implementation report for detail).

## Future replacement: `@nosana/kit` instead of shelling out to the CLI

This executor currently shells out to the installed `nosana` binary (`execFileSync`) because that
is the only mechanism available in this session (`@nosana/kit` is not a dependency of this
project). `@nosana/kit@2.7.0` exposes an in-memory `KeyPairSigner` you can assign directly —
`client.wallet = keypair` — letting a caller post/manage jobs entirely in-process, with a real
Solana keypair object instead of a keyfile path and a spawned child process. That is the intended
future replacement for the CLI shell-out in `deploy.mjs`'s Step 6–9 (posting + reconciliation):
same wallet-rail-only, same fail-closed gate, but no `execFileSync`, no on-disk keypair file, and
a typed SDK response instead of parsed CLI stdout — which would also close the "unverified JSON
shape" gap above by construction. Not implemented in S1 because `@nosana/kit` was not verified
against this repo's dependency set in this session; wiring it in is natural follow-up work
alongside the S3 self-renewing rent loop.
