// Regression test for the 2026-07-08 production incident: Franklin's real wake-cycle daemon
// (ai.anicca.franklin-loop) picked self/spawn for real, the money gate said eligible:true, but the
// spawn attempt then failed with "no resolvable per-instance identity (ANICCA_HOME/HOME) -- cannot
// determine drivingCitizenWallet". Root cause (confirmed by direct reproduction of the exact real
// subprocess chain): run.sh's own env-loading preamble does
//   set -a
//   [ -f "$HOME/.hermes/.env" ]   && . "$HOME/.hermes/.env"
//   [ -f "$HOME/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/.env" ] && . "$HOME/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/.env"
//   set +a
// -- `$HOME` is the real, SHARED macOS home (all instances on one machine run as the same OS user),
// not per-instance. `$HOME/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/.env` is the OpenClaw automaton's own shared secrets file and
// always sets its OWN `ANICCA_HOME` (e.g. `~/.local/state/rockstar_ibot`). `set -a` (allexport) means
// sourcing that file's `ANICCA_HOME=...` assignment silently overwrote the CALLER's correct
// per-instance `ANICCA_HOME` (e.g. Franklin's `/home/rockstar_ibot/.blockrun`, inherited correctly from the
// launchd plist through index.mjs's buildSkillEnv) with the automaton's — so
// resolve-identity.mjs's resolveEvmPrivateKey/resolveSolanaSecret then looked in the WRONG home,
// found no wallet file there, and fail-closed exactly as designed (the resolvers themselves were
// never buggy; run.sh handed them the wrong ANICCA_HOME).
//
// This test drives the REAL, unmodified skills/self/spawn/run.sh (not a copy) through its actual
// env-loading preamble, using a throwaway HOME with its own fixture `.openclaw/.env` that sets a
// DIFFERENT ANICCA_HOME (mirroring the real production conflict) plus one shared-secret var
// (mirroring the real reason run.sh sources that file at all: Akash signing key etc.). A stand-in
// `node` shim on PATH intercepts run.sh's final `exec "$NODE" ...` call and reports which env
// survived, instead of running the real wake-gate.mjs (zero side effects: no citizens.json write,
// no spawn attempt, no money movement).
