# earning-health-allslots.sh — GENERALIZES the sol-trade/pm-trade barren-earning CONTENT check
# (earning-health.py::is_fresh_but_barren) across every REQUIRED earn slot via ONE shared,
# registry-driven script (self-heal-allslots spec, REQ-AS-001..006). DRY: no per-slot copy-paste
# healthcheck.sh, no N launchd jobs — ONE job (ai.anicca.earning-health-allslots) iterates the
# registry and applies the SAME pure predicate `sol-trade-healthcheck.sh` already proved out.
#
# Adding barren-detection coverage for a new slot = add one registry entry (+ instrument that
# slot's own run.sh to emit {"action":"skip","reason":"..."} lines on a genuine mechanism
# rejection) — never write a new script. A registry entry with instrumented=false is a DOCUMENTED
# GAP (its gapNote explains why): this script logs it as NOT-INSTRUMENTED and NEVER calls
# self-fix.sh for it and NEVER prints OK/BARREN for it — never fabricate a verdict over data that
# does not exist (same "never fabricate, never brick" discipline earning-health.py's own docstring
# establishes).
#
# Instance-agnostic by design (REQ-AS-006): every path is resolved RELATIVE TO THIS SCRIPT'S OWN
# location (mirrors sol-trade-healthcheck.sh's SKILL_DIR-relative pattern), so whichever copy of
# the repo this runs from (a dev checkout, or an ANICCA_HOME-rsynced deployment such as Franklin's
# ~/.blockrun) checks ITS OWN adjacent registry/trace/state — never a different instance's
# hardcoded absolute path baked into shared OSS code. self-fix.sh's OWN bookkeeping paths
# ($HOME/.local/state/rockstar_ibot/{state,logs}) remain a documented graduation gap — see
# .vcsdd/features/self-heal-allslots/specs/behavioral-spec.md REQ-AS-006 / CHANGELOG.md.
