#
# The reality-verifier (skills/self/reality-verify-spawn.sh) is expensive (a fresh claude spawn), so
# it must NOT run every tick. This script fires it ONLY when a loop books a NEW external:true earn
# row since the last check — i.e. exactly when there is a real "I earned" CLAIM worth auditing. With
# zero new earns (today's state) it spawns nothing and costs nothing. Called at the end of the
# deterministic verify-loops audit (6h cadence) so the colony self-verifies its earnings honesty with
# NO human in the loop ("they can't stop").
#
# Fail-safe: any error is swallowed (never breaks the caller). DRYRUN=1 prints intended spawns only.
