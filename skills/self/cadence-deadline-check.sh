# cadence-deadline-check.sh — REQ-LV-102 (F-ITER3-1 fix): the "21:00 JST — did today's Cadence
# Contract get met" escalation, extracted into its OWN script so it can be triggered by a
# StartCalendarInterval (Hour=21, Minute=5, JST) launchd job — guaranteed to fire once a day at a
# fixed wall-clock time. The old approach relied on verify-loops-audit.sh's rolling
# StartInterval(6h) happening to land inside the [21:00,24:00) window, which depends on an unstable
# launchd-load-time offset: for roughly half of all possible offsets, that window is NEVER hit on
# any given day, so REQ-LV-102's escalation condition would go permanently unevaluated (the exact
# bug iteration-3 adversary review caught). This script is also still called from
# verify-loops-audit.sh's own 6h pass as a redundant safety net — harmless, since the per-loop
# marker file below makes a second call on the same JST day a no-op (whichever caller runs first
# claims the marker).

# docs/superpowers/evidence/LOOPS-TRUTH-AUDIT.md "escalation→self-fix実行のtriggerが切れてる"):
# standalone healthcheck.sh scripts for loops that don't source healthcheck-lib.sh (clip/video/
# clip-promote/connector-style) write a ".<loop>-core-selfheal-request.json" marker when they give
# up restarting a DEAD loop. Its own note says "read this on your next wake" -- but the loop that
# would read it is exactly the one that's dead, so it never wakes to read it. Confirmed 2026-07-11:
# clip-promote-core wrote such a marker (10:04 UTC) and self-fix ran ZERO times that day. Runs on
# EVERY invocation of this script (unlike the 21:00-JST-only Cadence Contract escalation below)
# since this script is already invoked twice a day for free: once by its own dedicated launchd
# (daily 21:05 JST) and once every 6h as a safety net from verify-loops-audit.sh -- giving the
# marker a real trigger with no new launchd job. self-fix.sh is itself idempotent (skips re-spawn
# while a fixer for that loop is still live, <180min hang ceiling) so calling it again here every
# pass is always safe; a marker still present after a fixer already ran (FAILed, or between runs)
# re-escalates naturally on the next pass -- no separate staleness/cooldown math needed.
