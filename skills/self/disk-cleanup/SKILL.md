# Rockstar_ibot disk cleanup

This skill owns the local host capacity pass. It is intentionally not a
Rockstar-Ibot-directory cleaner: it measures the Mac and only removes an
allow-listed regenerable artifact after an open-path probe confirms
`confirmed-closed`.

## Safety contract

- `.claude`, `.codex`, `.config/ai`, OpenClaw state/identity/workspace, `.git`,
  databases, credentials, cookies, source, and `state/*.jsonl` are preserved.
- Unknown paths, active leases, symlinks, open paths, and probe errors are
  preserved and recorded.
- `sweep()` accepts only candidates carrying internal allow-list discovery proof
  for the exact regenerable families; the CLI `--candidate` escape hatch is
  rejected so an arbitrary path cannot be promoted by an operator flag.
- The 5-minute pass has one atomic lock and no LLM deletion authority.
- Pressure is asserted below 11 GiB and is not cleared until the recovery floor
  is reached; the 20 GiB threshold starts preventive containment.
- Every pass atomically writes `host-inventory.json`: local `df` mounts and
  bounded owner-family metadata. The hourly/full compatibility pass may run a
  timeout-bounded `du` probe for allow-listed families; gaps are recorded as
  unknown and never become deletion candidates. The fallback adapter keeps a
  separate `cleanup-full-pass.at` marker so one bounded full cleanup occurs at
  most once per hour; a missing or stale marker is fail-closed toward
  observation/probe bounds, never toward deleting unknown paths.
- The host adapter bounds the governor, runtime-manifest, and sweep subprocesses;
  timeout is a preserve/error result and never advances the full-pass marker.
- Receipts are bounded and the high-volume cleanup ledger is rotated before it
  can consume the reserve.

## Local installation

```sh
skills/self/disk-cleanup/install-launchd.sh
```

The installer renders the user-specific plist, validates it with `plutil`, and
registers `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-disk-cleanup` at a 300-second interval. If
the macOS launchd user domain is temporarily unavailable, the existing
emergency guard invokes `disk_cleanup.py` as its single fallback owner. The
legacy hourly label is only a compatibility trigger: the guard's
`cleanup-full-pass.at` marker (or explicit `EMERGENCY_GUARD_FULL_PASS=1`) opts
into the bounded full pass so deferred worktree inspection is not permanently
skipped.

Run the tests with:

```sh
python3 -m pytest -q skills/self/disk-cleanup/tests/test_disk_cleanup.py
