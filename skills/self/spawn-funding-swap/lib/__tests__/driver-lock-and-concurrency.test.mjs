// VCSDD spawn-funding-swap Phase 2a (RED). REQ-005, REQ-010 — PROP-010, the concurrent-invocation
// canonical destination-address-keyed lock property, exercised against the REAL lock primitive (reuses
// the already-adversary-hardened `withGigLock`, economy/gig/lib/lock.mjs, unmodified — mirrors
// colony-spawn-lock.test.mjs's own reuse pattern for a different feature's lock). Written against
// lib/ledger-store.mjs's `createLedgerStore({ stateDir })` and lib/driver.mjs's `runSwap(deps)`, which do
// NOT exist yet — every test below MUST fail at module-load time (MODULE_NOT_FOUND) until Phase 2b.
