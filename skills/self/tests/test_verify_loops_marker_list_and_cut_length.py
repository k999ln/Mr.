"""test_verify_loops_marker_list_and_cut_length.py — self-heal.md FIND-002 regression lock
(adversary finding on commit 69b48dae, sprint-1 iteration-1: root cause #2's visibility fix —
verify-loops.sh's self-fix marker loop expanded 3->10 loops, verify-loops-audit.sh's mail cut
900->3000 — shipped as two plain literal edits with zero regression coverage; a future edit could
silently drop a loop name or shrink the cut back down and nothing would catch it before the exact
same invisible-diagnosis failure mode root cause #2 already produced once).

Static source-fidelity check (mirrors this codebase's own test_cadence_contracts_gig_source.py
convention — "entry is byte-for-byte unchanged" against the REAL shipped file, not a duplicated
hardcoded copy elsewhere): reads the actual verify-loops.sh / verify-loops-audit.sh source and
asserts the exact loop-name list and cut-length are present, never re-derives them from memory.
