# healthcheck-runtime-loop.sh — #7 H4 self-heal for the launchd-managed runtime/loop instances.
# healthcheck-lib.sh already covers the openclaw-style tmux loops (capafy/reddit/rockstar_ibot); this
# is the missing sibling for the three canonical Anicca-colony instances (spec §19/§25), which run
# `runtime/loop/index.mjs` directly under launchd (no tmux session to inspect):
#   anicca-a3cdd4 — com.anicca.daemon      (KeepAlive, body ~/.anicca)
#   Franklin      — ai.anicca.franklin-loop (KeepAlive, body ~/.blockrun) — migrated 2026-07-08 from
#                   the retired ai.anicca.franklin-sol StartInterval sol-trade job (franklin-loop-revival)
#   claude-p PM   — ai.anicca.pm-earner    (StartInterval 600s, body ~/.anicca-founder/agents/polymarket-agent)
# + ai.anicca.founder-loop (claude-p's separate low-priority "proxy body", wallet 0x810f, §25) —
#   checked too since it is still a live body sharing this infra, but is not one of the 3 canonical
#   earners.
#
# Health signal (KeepAlive vs StartInterval need DIFFERENT "dead" definitions):
#   - Job vanished from `launchctl list` entirely (unloaded/plist broken) → DEAD for either kind.
#   - KeepAlive job present but PID column is "-" → DEAD (should always have a live PID) → restart via
#     `launchctl kickstart -k`.
#   - StartInterval job's PID is "-" between runs → NORMAL, not a fault (only fires periodically).
#   - Either kind: the REAL output artifact (ledger.jsonl / trace.jsonl / a log) hasn't grown in
#     longer than that instance's own cadence allows → STALE (alive-but-stuck) → escalate to
#     self-fix.sh (same detached-Opus-fixer mechanism healthcheck-lib.sh already uses for the tmux
#     loops), never a hardcoded "this is broken" guess — the fixer reads the real logs itself.
#
# Usage: bash healthcheck-runtime-loop.sh          # check all
#        bash healthcheck-runtime-loop.sh <name>   # check one: a3cdd4 | franklin | pm-earner | founder-proxy
# NOT wired into cron/launchd by this script — scheduling is a separate, reviewed step (matches the
# #25 TELEM collector precedent: build + verify manually first).
