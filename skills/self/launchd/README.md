# skills/self/launchd/

launchd plists for `skills/self/`-level periodic scripts (not tied to one earn loop's own
`launchd/` dir — those live next to their loop, e.g. `skills/earn/clip/launchd/`).

| plist | runs | schedule | REQ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ai.anicca.verify-loops-audit.plist` | `verify-loops-audit.sh` | every 6h (`StartInterval` 21600s) | REQ-LV-042/103 |
| `ai.anicca.cadence-deadline-check.plist` | `cadence-deadline-check.sh` | daily at 21:05 JST (`StartCalendarInterval` Hour=21 Minute=5) | REQ-LV-102 |
| `ai.anicca.runtime-loop-healthcheck.plist` | `healthcheck-runtime-loop.sh` (checks all 4 targets: a3cdd4/franklin/pm-earner/founder-proxy) | every 5min (`StartInterval` 300s) | REQ-LV-050/051 |
| `ai.anicca.founder-loop-cadence.plist` | `../founder-loop/founder-loop.sh` (the ONE wake that writes `~/.anicca-founder/STATE.md`, which is what `cadence-contracts.json`'s `founder-loop` pass-marker actually watches) | every 30min (`StartInterval` 1800s), `RunAtLoad` true | gh #986 follow-up, 2026-07-10 |
| `ai.anicca.earning-health-allslots.plist` | `earning-health-allslots.sh` (registry-driven barren-earning CONTENT check across EVERY earn slot listed in `earning-health-registry.json` — generalizes what `sol-trade-healthcheck.sh` proved for `earn/sol-trade` alone; see `.vcsdd/features/self-heal-allslots/`) | every 5min (`StartInterval` 300s) | self-heal-allslots spec (P3), 2026-07-11 |

`ai.anicca.cadence-deadline-check.plist` uses `StartCalendarInterval` (fixed wall-clock time),
NOT `StartInterval` (rolling relative time) — REQ-LV-102's "escalate if today's Cadence Contract
is unmet by 21:00 JST" MUST fire at a guaranteed, fixed time. Piggy-backing this check on
`verify-loops-audit.sh`'s own 6h rolling `StartInterval` was tried first and found broken
(iteration-3 adversary review, F-ITER3-1): depending on the launchd-load-time offset, the 6h
schedule's four daily ticks can land entirely outside the `[21:00,24:00)` window for roughly half
of all possible offsets — meaning the escalation would go permanently, silently unevaluated on
some days. `cadence-deadline-check.sh` is copy+tweaked from the existing
`ai.anicca.cfo-daily.plist`/`ai.anicca.agentmail-nudge.plist` `StartCalendarInterval` pattern.
`verify-loops-audit.sh` still calls `cadence-deadline-check.sh` once per its own 6h pass too, as a
harmless redundant safety net (the per-loop-per-day marker file makes a second call on the same
JST day a no-op).

`ai.anicca.runtime-loop-healthcheck.plist`'s 300s interval satisfies REQ-LV-050's "at or below the
smallest per-target staleness threshold" bar (a3cdd4's 20min threshold is the smallest of the 4;
300s = 5min is well under it, so a DEAD/STALE target is caught on the very next tick rather than
waiting up to a full threshold window).

`ai.anicca.founder-loop-cadence.plist` exists because `founder-loop.sh` was ALWAYS a standalone
script ("A cadence (/loop, cron, launchd) wraps this" per its own header) but had never actually
been wired to one -- `ai.anicca.founder-loop.plist` (the pre-existing, differently-scoped job with
the confusingly similar label `ai.anicca.founder-loop`) runs the general always-on
`runtime/loop/index.mjs` daemon body for this instance, NOT `founder-loop.sh`. Nothing ever invoked
`founder-loop.sh`, so `~/.anicca-founder/STATE.md` (what `cadence-contracts.json`'s `founder-loop`
pass-marker watches) only advanced on the rare occasion someone ran it by hand -- explaining the
repeated 21:05 JST cadence-deadline-check self-fix escalations (2026-07-08 x2, 07-09, 07-10) before
this job existed. `founder-loop.sh` itself was also missing an explicit `PATH` export, so its first
launchd-scheduled run silently died at `node "$RECORD"` ("node: command not found", rc 127) even
after this plist was installed -- fixed in the script directly (now exports PATH like every sibling
`self/*.sh` launchd script), verified by a real `record_rc=0` run under `launchctl kickstart`.

`ai.anicca.earning-health-allslots.plist`'s `EARNHC_EARN_STATE_DIR` points at Franklin's own
deployed `~/.blockrun/skills/earn/state` (mirrors the pre-existing
`ai.anicca.sol-trade-earning-healthcheck.plist`'s `SOL_TRADE_HC_TRACE` override) so this ONE job
checks FRANKLIN's real `earn/sol-trade` + `earn/polymarket-trade` traces, not the shared dev
checkout's empty ones. **Before loading this plist, unload+remove the older
`ai.anicca.sol-trade-earning-healthcheck.plist`** — both would otherwise independently detect the
same `earn/sol-trade` barren condition and each spawn its own `self-fix.sh sol-trade` call
(duplicate, wasteful fixer spawns; not unsafe, but not intended). This plist is committed but
**NOT loaded** by the self-heal-allslots sprint that added it — Dais reviews first (see
`.vcsdd/features/self-heal-allslots/CHANGELOG.md`).

## Install (orchestrator step, run after merge)

```bash
cp skills/self/launchd/ai.anicca.cadence-deadline-check.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.cadence-deadline-check.plist

cp skills/self/launchd/ai.anicca.runtime-loop-healthcheck.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.runtime-loop-healthcheck.plist

cp skills/self/launchd/ai.anicca.founder-loop-cadence.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.founder-loop-cadence.plist
```

## Verify (REQ-LV-051)

```bash
launchctl list | grep ai.anicca.cadence-deadline-check
launchctl list | grep ai.anicca.runtime-loop-healthcheck
launchctl list | grep ai.anicca.founder-loop-cadence
```

Should each print a line with the job's PID (or `-` between ticks/before the next scheduled fire,
which is normal for both `StartInterval` and `StartCalendarInterval` jobs — see
`healthcheck-runtime-loop.sh`'s own `hrl_classify()` docstring: PID `-` between runs is NOT a fault
for an interval-type job, only for a `KeepAlive` one).

## Uninstall

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.cadence-deadline-check.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.cadence-deadline-check.plist

launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.runtime-loop-healthcheck.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.runtime-loop-healthcheck.plist

launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.founder-loop-cadence.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.anicca.founder-loop-cadence.plist
```
