# One bounded Rockstar_ibot SELF-BUILD pass (spec §10 row 10f, §9.3 DEV loop).
#
# This is the launchd entrypoint for `ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-selfbuild` — the CONSUMER. It does
# exactly one thing per day: hand the oldest eligible loop-authored fix PR to the 10e merge guard,
# then report what actually happened. It decides nothing about merging — every gate lives in the
# guard. The PRODUCER (`ai.anicca.rockstar_ibot-dev`) is a different job with a different label.
#
# It mirrors rockstar_ibot-daily.sh: PATH first, recursion guard, env sourcing, one log file, one
# honest Telegram report at the end. Differences are deliberate:
#   * the report is sent whatever the outcome, INCLUDING a no-op day, because 10f's done condition
#     is seven distinct days each carrying an honest outcome — a silent day looks like a dead loop;
#   * the report is built from the LAST LINE OF THE LEDGER, never from the CLI's stdout and never
#     from a claim. Those differ in exactly the cases that matter: a pass that appended its row and
#     then died before printing would otherwise report nothing, and a pass that printed a row it
#     never managed to append would report a day that does not exist. The ledger is the evidence
#     10f is measured by, so the ledger is what gets read.
#
# This script never loads, unloads or edits its own launchd job — a loop that can schedule itself
# can also un-pause itself. Enabling the schedule is a separate, explicit operator step:
#   apps/rockstar_ibot/scripts/enable-self-build-launchd.sh
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# The day boundary is Asia/Tokyo, and "seven distinct days" is the entire done condition. launchd's
# StartCalendarInterval carries no time-zone field, so the SCHEDULE follows whatever the machine is
# set to; re-asserting TZ here means that even if the machine's zone is changed months from now, or
# the plist is edited, or this script is run by hand from some other context, the pass's own day
# arithmetic cannot drift and start splitting or merging days.
