# Mercor

Mercor is a global provider lane of Rockstar_ibot's existing Job Hunter system. It is not limited to Japanese jobs: route Japanese, English, bilingual, business, AI-agent, research, data/CRM, product, and other grounded role families through the same fact gate. Use this skill for provider policy and routing; `apps/job-search-loop/` remains the sole owner of browser and application side effects.

## Canonical owners

- Candidate truth and resume variants: `skills/job-hunter/` and `~/.config/anicca/job-search/profile.json`
- Browser/application runtime: `apps/job-search-loop/`
- Cadence: `loops/job-hunter/`
- Private Mercor state: `~/.local/state/anicca/job-search/mercor/`
- Integration spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-mercor-rockstar_ibot-consolidation.md`

## Authentication hard stops

1. Use ordinary Google sign-in and inject the Keychain password only into the isolated UI. Never print or persist the secret.
2. Never click a browser Google 2FA button with accessible name `はい`; the user alone approves `はい` inside the Gmail iOS app.
3. Never use account recovery, reset, registration, recovery-email, or recursive alternate-method paths.
4. On any recovery/reset/wait screen, record the URL and visible text and stop.
5. Never use another site's tab or the trusted daily-driver browser.

## Application policy

- Reconcile an existing in-progress Mercor application before discovering a new listing.
- Apply only with verified profile facts and a read-back-verified resume artifact.
- Do not impersonate interviews or assessments. The Japanese Evaluator's 14-minute camera/microphone `Domain Expert Interview` is completed and the application page reads `Your application has been submitted!`; reconcile the review result and never resubmit the same application.
- Unsupported questions, CAPTCHA, and ambiguous attestations become `needs_human`.
- Count earnings only from an authoritative Mercor Earnings/contract settlement read-back; never count views, invitations, estimates, or pending offers.

## Ready-to-submit automation

When a new listing page shows `3 of 3 steps completed`, `100%`, completed Domain Expert Interview reuse, and a visible `Submit application`, the existing hourly Job Hunter loop may submit exactly one new listing in that wake. It must deduplicate against the private ledger, read back the submitted state, and never resubmit an existing pending application.

## Reusable open-source macro loop

Treat this as a provider module for any operator, not as a shared account or a guaranteed-income machine. Each operator must supply their own resume/facts, Google/Mercor session, payment setup, Calendar, interview/assessment completion, capacity, locales, and exclusions. Keep those inputs in the operator's private XDG state root; never commit them or reuse another operator's credentials.

The loop owns recurring discovery, ready-form submission, Gmail/Calendar reconciliation, reminders, evidence, duplicate protection, and settled-earnings accounting. It does not impersonate interviews, assessments, or paid work where Mercor prohibits AI/automation. `$10K verified` means three consecutive cycles of actual settled payouts, not an offer or an estimated capacity.

The execution style is model-led: observe the live page, reason about the next action, and adapt to page drift. Keep deterministic code small and boundary-focused—owned browser session, domain allowlist, lease, dedupe, one guarded submit, read-back, evidence, and ledger. Do not turn every possible UI branch into a brittle script.

## Calendar policy

- Reuse `apps/job-search-loop/job_search_loop/interview_scheduling.py` and `calendar_sync.py` for every Mercor interview, regardless of locale.
- Classify the Gmail/Mercor thread, require explicit start/end/timezone, check Calendar FreeBusy, and create one idempotent private event with prep reminders.
- Human glue is limited to authorization, ambiguous scheduling, attending the interview, and human-bound assessments. Never impersonate an interview.

## Loop contract

The existing hourly `job-hunter` acquisition loop is the only loop. Do not create a second Mercor executor. The provider adapter must acquire the existing pass lease, deduplicate listings, submit at most the bounded per-wake quota, record evidence, and release the lease in a finally path.
