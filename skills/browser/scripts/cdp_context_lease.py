"""Give each loop its own browser space so they stop destroying each other's work.

Every loop drives the same Chromium. When gig is halfway through a 応募 form and the clip loop
navigates "the" tab, gig's work is gone — and neither loop can tell that it happened.

CDP has the answer already: Target.createBrowserContext is "Similar to an incognito profile but you
can have more than one". So each task leases its own context, and nothing another loop does can reach
into it. Contexts do not share cookies, so the lease seeds the fresh context from the session vault —
the same trick as Playwright's storageState ("reuse this state and start already authenticated").

    write landing during that window got silently overwritten by gc's unconditional
    `_save(leases)` of its stale start-of-call snapshot: the victim's next heartbeat then
    returned lease_not_found. Fix: read candidates under the lock, dispose outside it (so
    other callers are not blocked on slow CDP calls), then re-open the lock per row and
    only pop it if the ledger still shows the *same* lease (same context/target id) and it

    Accepted edge: a 45-min-stale row re-acquired via acquire's reuse path during the
    dispose window survives with a dead context; the next acquire's target_responds
    check detects the corpse and rebuilds it (self-healing, reviewer-accepted).

    Pid-liveness fast path: idle_min alone means a holder killed with -9 can sit in the
