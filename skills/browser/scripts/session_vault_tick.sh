# ── per-account clip browsers (clip-en, clip-en2, clip-en3, ...) ──
# Guard: clip_pass.sh drives these same Chrome profiles concurrently (posting via instagrapi,
# some CDP use). Opening extra tabs on the same IG-authenticated profile while a pass is live
# risks a concurrent-session signature_revoked (see TASKLIST 3a). So the whole clip block
# (dump + keepalive both open CDP tabs) is skipped, not just keepalive, whenever a pass is
# running — dump()'s localStorage snapshot also opens an instagram.com tab.
# If a clip browser is down, relaunch it against its existing (already-logged-in) profile dir
# before giving up on it — this is what plugs the "SKIP (browser not up)" hole: a dead browser
# used to just get skipped forever, so its session never got warmed and eventually rotted.
# Never touches creds/login: this only spawns Chromium pointed at the profile's own
# user-data-dir, which restores whatever cookies are already saved on disk.
