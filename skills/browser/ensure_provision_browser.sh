# ensure_provision_browser.sh — bring up a DEDICATED CloakBrowser for account provisioning and
# hand back its leased CDP base URL.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (root cause, measured 2026-07-30): capafy-ig-marketing-daily.sh hardcoded
# IG_PROVISION_PORT=9332 and NOTHING in any skill ever launched a browser on 9332. Every pass since
# 2026-07-19 therefore stopped at "dedicated CDP port 9332 was unavailable", wrote a provision_failed
# row, and exited 0 — 11 silent days with zero posts. A port is not a browser and a port is not an
# identity: ~/.config/ai/registry/browsers.toml says "Ports are derived at runtime (launch with
# --remote-debugging-port=0 and read the real one from DevToolsActivePort inside the profile). Never
# hardcode a port". This script is the missing launcher for that doctrine.
#
#   bash ensure_provision_browser.sh <identity>     # -> stdout: http://127.0.0.1:<live-port>
#
# Exit 0 = browser is up on a dynamically allocated free port AND this caller holds the guard lease.
# Any non-zero exit means the caller MUST NOT proceed to provisioning (and must not exit 0 itself).
#
# ★ It never touches the daily-driver (interactive:dais) or gig (coconala:kosuke) profile. Those are
#   forever browsers holding Dais's logins; killing or stealing one is the cardinal sin. This script
#   only ever launches/repairs its OWN provisioning profile and refuses outright if the identity it
#   was given resolves to a protected profile. ★
