# web search/scrape (firecrawl, $0 API), and return a concise markdown research brief. At $0 input
# cost, every paid request ($0.02 USDC to anicca's wallet) is pure profit.

# The old default `agent-reach format --json --query {q}` is BROKEN (the installed agent-reach CLI now
# only supports `format xhs`). firecrawl is the project's canonical web tool and works today.

# Usage: research-product.sh "<buyer query>"  → prints markdown to stdout.
