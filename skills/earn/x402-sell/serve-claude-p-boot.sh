# gets an explicit https resource distinct from the founder seller on :8411/443.

# T2 fix (2026-07-25): the physical machine's own tailscale node (aniccanomac-mini-1) lost Funnel
# authorization -- `tailscale funnel --bg --https=8443 8412` now HANGS forever printing "Funnel is
# enabled, but the list of allowed nodes in the tailnet policy file does not include the one you
# are using" (confirmed live: sample'd the boot script parked in __wait4() for 11h, node never
# started). Its hostname also has NO public DNS record at all (dig @8.8.8.8/@1.1.1.1 both empty;
# confirmed CDP Bazaar's live catalog has zero listings under aniccanomac-mini-1) -- so even a
# successful bind was invisible to any real buyer. tsbridge (ai.anicca.tsbridge,
# ~/.tsbridge/tsbridge.toml) already runs claude-p as its OWN authorized tsnet node with a public
# DNS record (dig @8.8.8.8 claude-p.tail7a0ba4.ts.net resolves) -- same fix already proven for
# franklin1. Point PUBLIC_URL there and drop the funnel call entirely (tsbridge does not need it).
