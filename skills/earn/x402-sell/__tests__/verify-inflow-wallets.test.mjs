// node:test — the SELF_WALLETS list (shared by verify-inflow.mjs and store-review.mjs) must not
// under-count what it excludes.
//
// WHY (2026-07-16): verify-inflow is the ONLY judge of "did we earn" (SKILL.md step 7), but its
// wallet set was missing addresses that a SIBLING judge had already identified as internal.
// founder-loop/record-earn.mjs:40-49 records the 2026-07-12 forensic finding: 0xf70da978… is the
// source of both of the two largest "earn" rows ever recorded ($22.97 + $7.98), is a plain EOA
// holding >$3.1M USDC on Base, and is therefore funding routed THROUGH us, not revenue. That judge
// fail-closes on it. This one never learned, so it still reports those transfers as EXTERNAL --
// and franklin1's $6.4778 from the same address looked like a first sale.
//
// The rule being pinned: an address that ANY judge in the colony has classified as internal must be
// internal in EVERY judge. Revenue is the number we are least allowed to overstate.
//
// SELF-STORE-1 (2026-07-18): the list moved out of verify-inflow.mjs into lib/self-wallets.mjs so
// store-review.mjs can share it too — this test now reads the shared module directly.
