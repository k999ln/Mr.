# serve-franklin1-boot.sh — KeepAlive launchd boot of franklin1's (~/.blockrun) x402 seller on :8414.
# Same recipe as serve-claude-p-boot.sh/serve-mainnet-boot.sh/serve-franklin2-boot.sh (x402-sell/
# SKILL.md), a fourth replication: same serve.mjs/primitives.mjs, franklin1's OWN payTo
# (receiving-only, no key needed here) and its own Tailscale Funnel https port so the CDP Bazaar
# crawler gets an explicit https resource distinct from the other sellers on :8411/:8412/:8413.
#
# WHY this exists (x402-seller-persistence 2026-07-14): franklin1 had NO dedicated x402 seller at
# all (no boot script, no port of its own in its loop plist) — when its earn-loop picked the
# x402_sell slot, run.sh's in-wake nohup fallback used the bare default port 8404, which was
# ALREADY occupied by an unrelated stray process (a different wallet's payTo). run.sh's curl-ping
# guard saw that stray process as "already up" and never booted franklin1's own seller, so a
# franklin1 x402_sell wake silently reported success while never actually exposing franklin1's OWN
# payTo. A dedicated port + dedicated KeepAlive job removes the collision permanently.
#
# WHY the URL changed again (T2b-6, 2026-07-17): Tailscale Funnel only listens on 443/8443/10000
# (official), so ":10001" below was never externally reachable — it just silently no-op'd
# `tailscale funnel --https=10001`, and this process kept advertising a dead URL forever. tsbridge
# (docs/STATUS.md T2b-2/T2b-3, launchd ai.anicca.tsbridge) now gives franklin1 its own tsnet node
# with its own :443 at https://franklin1.tail7a0ba4.ts.net, reverse-proxying to this same :8414 —
# so the fix is just pointing this seller's advertised URL at that node instead of running a second,
# broken tunnel of its own.
