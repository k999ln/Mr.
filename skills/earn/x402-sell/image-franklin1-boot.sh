# T2 fix (2026-07-25): aniccanomac-mini-1 (the physical machine's own tailscale node) has NO
# public DNS record at all (dig @8.8.8.8/@1.1.1.1 both empty) and zero CDP Bazaar listings under
# it, despite `tailscale serve status` locally claiming the /image, /openapi.json, and
# /base-usdc-balance paths were funneled on :443 -- that funnel state is stale/unauthorized
# (`tailscale funnel --bg ...` against this node now hangs forever: "Funnel is enabled, but the
# list of allowed nodes in the tailnet policy file does not include the one you are using"). No
# outside buyer could ever have reached this product. tsbridge (~/.tsbridge/tsbridge.toml) now
# runs a dedicated "franklin1-image" tsnet node for this backend (same proven pattern as
# franklin1/franklin2/claude-p) with working public DNS -- point PUBLIC_URL there and drop the
# funnel calls (tsbridge proxies the whole backend at its own root, no --set-path needed).
