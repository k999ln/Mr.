"""pinnacle_observe.py -- OBSERVATION-ONLY wrapper around pinnacle_edge.py for run.sh.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-12, see docs/loop-engineering/30-pinnacle-edge-measurement.md):
pinnacle_edge.py is proven-correct (32/32 tests, three real false-edges caught and killed) but the
first live measurement found ZERO comparable games -- Pinnacle carries tomorrow's pre-match lines
while Polymarket lists today's already-started games, so the two data sources never overlapped in
that one 20-minute window. n=0 means the edge's existence is UNKNOWN, not "no" and not "yes". The
correct next step is to accumulate observations across many wake-ups until games that are
pre-match on BOTH sides at once actually appear, and only then judge whether the disagreement is
real. This module is that accumulation step and NOTHING else.

HARD CONSTRAINT: this module NEVER places an order. It does not import place_order.py,
bundle_arb.py, or market_maker.py, and it does not call the CLOB client. It only reads (via
pinnacle_edge.py's own read-only fetchers) and appends one JSON line per invocation to
state/pinnacle-observations.jsonl -- including when zero games were comparable, because that
absence is itself the data point this exists to collect. PINNACLE_LIVE (a future env-gated
trading switch) does not exist anywhere in this repo yet; wiring it up is a separate, later
change, not something this file should anticipate with dead code.

Called by run.sh once per pass, after the existing strategies, with `|| true` around it -- a
failure here must never fail the pass or place a bet. pinnacle_edge.py's own MIN_FETCH_INTERVAL_S
cache already caps the paid Odds-API reads to ~5/day; this file adds no extra throttling.
