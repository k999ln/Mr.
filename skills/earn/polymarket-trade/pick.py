pick.py — ALPHA: PM autonomous market/side/size picker (#25 spec §2.1).

NOTHING about WHICH market or WHICH side is hardcoded here (HARD #0 / #1 of
this task). The MODEL decides:
  - multi-model consensus (AIAnalyzer.consensus_analysis, 3 FREE BlockRun
    models — NVIDIA-hosted llama-4-maverick + qwen3-next + mistral-nemotron,
    $0 inference, #31; env-overridable via EARN_CONSENSUS_MODELS) estimates the
    true probability and votes BULLISH/BEARISH/MIXED,
  - smart-money / whale signal (get_smart_money_summary) is fed into that
    same consensus call as context.
This file only: fetches candidates, filters/sorts them (resolve-soon +
liquidity — bookkeeping, not judgment), runs the model's consensus+whale
analysis, GATES on the model's own edge/confidence/consensus output, sizes
via Kelly, and CAPS the size (money-safety, not judgment). Fails CLOSED to
WAIT whenever a signal is missing or nothing clears the gate — it never
picks a default market/side.

Env (all optional, defaults shown — self-improve loop tunes these, spec §4):
  MIN_EDGE=0.15            minimum |avg_edge| from consensus to act
  MIN_CONF=7               minimum avg_confidence (1-10 scale) to act
  RESOLVE_HORIZON_DAYS=14  drop candidates resolving further out than this
  MIN_LIQUIDITY=5000       USD, passed straight to fetch_active_markets
  MIN_ODDS=0.15            YES-odds floor, passed straight to fetch_active_markets
  MAX_ODDS=0.85            YES-odds ceiling, passed straight to fetch_active_markets
  MAX_BET_SIZE=2           USD hard cap on the sized bet (money-safety, #26/#28)
  MAX_CANDIDATES=5         how many resolve-soonest candidates to run
                           consensus+whale analysis on (cost bound, not judgment)
  PM_TRADE_AGENT_HOME      override for the base agent home (default below)

Output: exactly one line of JSON on the REAL stdout (guaranteed clean — see below).
  qualifying candidate found ->
    {"token_id","side":"BUY","outcome":"YES"|"NO","amount","market","end_date",
     "edge","confidence","consensus"}
  nothing qualifies, or a required signal is unavailable ->
    {"action":"WAIT","reason":"<why>"}   (fail-closed — never a default bet)

CLEAN-STDOUT GUARANTEE (#25 adversary fix, accounting integrity, 2026-07-05):
a real Franklin fill was once mis-logged ok:false because an imported module
printed to stdout and merged onto the same line as the result JSON, breaking
run.sh's json.loads(). Fix: `sys.stdout` at process start is captured as
`_REAL_STDOUT` before any heavy import; ALL work (imports, market fetch, AI
analysis, whale signal) runs under `contextlib.redirect_stdout(sys.stderr)`,
so any stray print() from this file's own imports or the base agent's src.*
modules lands on stderr. The ONLY thing ever written to `_REAL_STDOUT` is the
single final `_emit(...)` call below — stdout is guaranteed to be exactly one
clean JSON line.
