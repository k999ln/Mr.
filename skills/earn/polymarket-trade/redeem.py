redeem.py — collect (redeem) claude-p's RESOLVED, redeemable Polymarket positions,
turning open unrealized value into realized pUSD cash in the SAME deposit wallet.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Trading (v2_recipe.py / v2_full_flow.py) only OPENS positions. Nothing in this repo
ever collected a win — every position sat "redeemable=True" with real cash owed and
$0 actually realized. This is that missing last step: colony's first realized profit.

THE MECHANISM (verified against the installed SDK, not guessed)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The deposit wallet (`0x904B50d2…`, ERC-1167 proxy, POLY_1271 sig_type=3) is NOT an
EOA, so it can't sign its own transactions — every write goes through Polymarket's
gasless relayer, signed by the owner EOA (`0x810F6D61…`). This is the exact same
relayer path `v2_mint_deploy.py` already proved live for wallet deployment: SIWE
mint (no browser) -> RelayerApiKey -> `polymarket.clients.secure.SecureClient`.

That installed SDK (`polymarket-client` 0.1.0b13, in `.venv-pysdk`) ships a native
`SecureClient.redeem_positions(condition_id=...)` (secure.py:2188). It already knows
how to pick the right on-chain path per market:
  - regular CTF market  -> `ConditionalTokens.redeemPositions` via the collateral
    adapter (`normalize_market_position_context`, positions.py:66-95)
  - neg-risk market      -> the neg-risk collateral adapter instead
by reading the market's OWN `negRisk` flag (fetched via `list_markets`) — this is
mechanical dispatch on a fixed on-chain fact, not a strategy judgment, so it is
correctly deterministic code (R5), same as picking a URL scheme.

TWO REAL SDK GAPS FOUND (verified live, fixed here, not worked around blindly):
  1. `redeem_positions()`'s own market lookup omits `closed=True`, and Gamma's
     `/markets` endpoint silently excludes closed/resolved markets unless that
     flag is explicit (verified: `curl gamma-api/markets?slug=X` -> `[]`,
     `...&closed=true` -> the market). Since redeem() only ever targets RESOLVED
     (closed) markets, the wrapper always raised "No market found". Fixed by
     calling the same low-level primitives with `closed=True` in the lookup
     (`redeem_condition`, below).
  2. Before ANY redeem, the deposit wallet must grant the adapter contract
     ERC-1155 `setApprovalForAll` on the raw ConditionalTokens contract — verified
     by `eth_call` simulation: redeeming without it reverts
     `"ERC1155: need operator approval for 3rd party transfers"`; querying
     `CTF.isApprovedForAll(deposit_wallet, collateral_adapter)` on-chain returned
     `False`. This is the one-time step Polymarket's own web UI does silently
     before a user's first redeem; `ensure_ctf_operator_approval` does it here,
     idempotently (checks `isApprovedForAll` first, only sends a tx if needed).
     It authorizes redemption only — it cannot move pUSD/USDC and is fully
     revocable (`approved=False`).

Sources (quoted, no guessing):
  - installed `polymarket` package, `clients/secure.py::redeem_positions`,
    `::approve_erc1155_for_all`, and
    `_internal/actions/relayer/positions.py::normalize_market_position_context`
    (ground truth — this IS what ships, not docs about it).
  - `v2_mint_deploy.py` (this dir) — the proven-live SIWE/RelayerApiKey mint flow,
    reused verbatim here via `_mint_relayer_api_key`.
  - data-api `https://data-api.polymarket.com/positions` — the source of which
    conditions are `redeemable=True` and how much they're worth right now.
  - live `eth_call` against Polygon mainnet (this session, 2026-07-05) — confirmed
    each conditionId's `payoutDenominator`/`payoutNumerators` on the raw CTF
    contract is set (i.e. genuinely resolved on-chain), and confirmed the missing
    ERC-1155 approval as the exact revert cause. Note: `CTF.getPositionId` shows
    the actually-held ERC-1155 token IDs are derived from **USDC.e** collateral
    (`0x2791Bca1…`), not pUSD, even though V2 trading itself settles in pUSD —
    this script still passes `env.collateral_token` (pUSD) to the adapter call
    exactly as the SDK's own `redeem_positions()` does (unchanged from its
    internal code), since the adapter (not raw CTF) is the actual call target and
    is Polymarket's own tested conversion path; the real payout currency is
    confirmed empirically after the tx (pUSD balance check), not assumed here.

Ledger: results are appended via the CANONICAL earn-ledger writer
(`__REPO_ROOT__/skills/earn/lib/record.mjs`) — this file does not reimplement the
GATE-0 classifier or the malice-guard; it only derives the {earn,cost,tx,status}
facts and hands them to the existing writer.

NO DRY RUN — running `main()` submits real on-chain redeem transactions.
