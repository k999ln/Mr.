merge.py — RECOVER-1: merge a balanced YES/NO leg pair back into pUSD collateral
via the installed polymarket-client SDK's native `SecureClient.merge_positions`.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
---------------------
redeem.py only collects RESOLVED (closed) markets. AUDIT-1 (2026-07-17) found claude-p
holding an OPEN (unresolved) Fed-rate market position — 13 YES / 5 NO shares — where the
balanced 5+5 pair is mergeable RIGHT NOW, permissionless, no counterparty/liquidity needed
(CTF mergePositions burns one YES + one NO token 1:1 for 1 unit of collateral). This is
NOT a redeem (market isn't resolved) and NOT a sale (no orderbook liquidity needed) — it
is a third, distinct CTF primitive this repo had no script for.

MECHANISM (verified against the installed SDK, ground truth not docs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
`polymarket.clients.secure.SecureClient.merge_positions(condition_id=..., amount=...)`
(secure.py:2110) already exists in the SDK redeem.py imports from (`polymarket-client`
0.1.0b13, `.venv-pysdk`). Reuses redeem.py's already-proven `build_client()` (SIWE mint,
no browser) and `ensure_ctf_operator_approval()` (same ERC-1155 operator grant redeem
needs — verified live 2026-07-17: both COLLATERAL_ADAPTER and NEG_RISK_COLLATERAL_ADAPTER
already `isApprovedForAll=True` for claude-p's deposit wallet from prior redeem runs, so
this call needs zero new approval tx).

`amount="max"` resolves (SDK's own `resolve_merge_amount_from_balances`) to the largest
BALANCED amount actually held — i.e. min(YES balance, NO balance) — so it can never merge
more than what both legs actually hold, and never needs the caller to hand-compute base
units (6-decimal share counts) itself.

Sources (quoted, no guessing):
  - installed `polymarket` package, `clients/secure.py::merge_positions` (line 2110) —
    ground truth, read directly from the installed wheel in this session.
  - `_internal/actions/relayer/positions.py::resolve_merge_amount_from_balances` — the
    "max = balanced amount held" resolution, read directly.
  - live `data-api.polymarket.com/positions?user=0x904B50d2…` (this session) — confirmed
    `"mergeable": true` on both legs, conditionId
    `0x8bf1c1536ecb1c08fe13c6b71e8ab1f58bf3461c4cb79f5f1679f869a06aef86`,
    YES size=13 avgPrice=0.6923, NO size=5 avgPrice=0.26, negativeRisk=true.
  - live `isApprovedForAll` eth_call (this session) — both adapters already approved,
    zero new approval tx needed.

Ledger: same CANONICAL earn-ledger writer as redeem.py (record.mjs), source
"polymarket-merge". cost_usdc = the ACTUAL cost basis of the merged shares
(avgPrice * merged_amount per leg, summed) — never fabricated, computed from the
data-api's own avgPrice for the exact merged size.

NO DRY RUN — running `main()` submits a real on-chain merge transaction.
