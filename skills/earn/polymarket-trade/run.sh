# --- per-instance identity resolution (#26 EQUALIZE, R3; #27 fix, 2026-07-05) ----------
# BUG FIXED (#27, cross-instance money leak): the OLD order skipped resolve-identity
# whenever the SHARED agent .env already had a POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY (claude-p's own
# 0x810f) — so automaton/Franklin, which run this SAME script via their own body copies
# WITHOUT an explicit key export, would fall through to that shared key and sign/trade on
# claude-p's wallet, not their own. Fix: resolve THIS instance's OWN key FIRST.
#
# ANICCA_HOME-gated (not "call resolve-identity unconditionally and trust it comes back
# empty for claude-p" — VERIFIED that assumption is false on this shared machine): with
# ANICCA_HOME unset, resolve-identity.mjs's OWN default derivation falls back to
# $HOME/.anicca, which — on THIS box — IS automaton's real home, so an unset-ANICCA_HOME
# call does NOT come back empty, it returns automaton's key. So we only ATTEMPT
# resolve-identity when ANICCA_HOME is EXPLICITLY set in the environment — which is true
# for automaton (com.anicca.daemon.plist exports ANICCA_HOME=~/.anicca) and Franklin
# (ai.anicca.franklin-loop.plist exports ANICCA_HOME=~/.blockrun), and NEVER true for
# claude-p (its only production pm-trade job, ai.anicca.pm-earner.plist, has no
# EnvironmentVariables and calls run_earner.sh directly, bypassing this file entirely; an
# ad-hoc run of THIS file with ANICCA_HOME unset now safely falls through to the agent
# .env below instead of silently grabbing automaton's key). resolve-identity itself is
# still EFFECTIVE_HOME-gated (#28) so a foreign home never returns the wrong instance's key.
