"""daily_loss_guard.py — the ONE hummingbot/alpha-mcp-shaped risk control this repo was missing.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-25, decision-loop task). The existing money-safety primitives are:
  - per-trade cap: MAX_BET_SIZE / MAX_PASS_SPEND (pick.py, bundle_arb.py, market_maker.py) — bounds
    ONE trade / ONE pass.
  - LIFETIME circuit breaker: redeem.py/merge.py's check_cumulative_halt() + write_kill_switch() —
    trips the shared KILL file if cumulative earn-vs-spend ever goes insolvent across every redeem
    EVER recorded (funding/lib/kill_switch.py's is_killed() is the read side of that same file).
  What was missing, and what hummingbot's `kill_switch_rate` / alpha-mcp's "Daily loss limit: 5%"
  both have in their risk-control shape: a guard scoped to a ROLLING WINDOW (today), not lifetime —
  a bad day can look fine against a lifetime-cumulative number for weeks before that guard trips.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it does not change any strategy/edge logic (pick.py, pinnacle_edge.py,
bundle_arb.py, market_maker.py are untouched by this file). It does not invent a new halt
mechanism — it reuses the EXACT SAME KILL file every other guard in this skill already checks
(SPEC/SKILL.md "kill-switch: touch KILL in this dir"), via the same write_kill_switch() shape
redeem.py/merge.py already use (a plain text file, fail-closed, checked at the top of the next
pass). This file is a NEW pure decision function + a thin ledger-reading wrapper around it, tested
in test_daily_loss_guard.py exactly like no_naked.py's pure functions are tested in
test_no_naked.py.

Per-trade "triple barrier" (hummingbot's stop_loss/take_profit/time_limit): deliberately NOT
added as new code. On a binary prediction market, a position resolves to exactly $0 or $1 — a
BUY's maximum possible loss is already hard-capped at MAX_BET_SIZE (stronger than a stop-loss:
no slippage/gap risk, the loss can never exceed the stake) and RESOLVE_HORIZON_DAYS=14 already
functions as the time-exit (pick.py refuses any market resolving further out than that). There is
no equivalent of "take-profit" for a buy-and-hold-to-resolution binary bet in this strategy's
design — adding active mid-position selling would be new strategy behavior, out of scope
("do not redesign the strategy").
