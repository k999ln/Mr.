"""pinnacle_edge.py — find markets where Polymarket disagrees with the sharpest book in the world.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-12). Every trade this agent has actually profited from was a one-sided bet
made after someone looked something up: verified against Polymarket's own data-api, the researched
directional bets returned +$9.78 across 4 wins, while the hedged bundle-arb legs returned +$0.24 in
total. Meanwhile pick.py's consensus engine was handed only the market's question text and the
market's own current price -- no news, no search, no outside information of any kind -- so its LLMs
could never estimate a probability the market did not already know, and it correctly said WAIT
forever. The missing ingredient was never capital. It was information.

THE EDGE. Pinnacle is the benchmark sportsbook: it does not limit winning bettors, runs 1-3% vig,
and its lines are shaped by professional syndicates -- so its no-vig price is the closest thing to a
true probability that is publicly available. Polymarket's price, by contrast, is a retail order book
that reacts more slowly. Where the two disagree by more than the noise, the disagreement itself is
the edge, and it requires predicting nothing: we are not forecasting the game, we are copying the
sharper forecaster and buying the side the softer market has mispriced.

This module is pure arithmetic + two read-only HTTP reads. It DECIDES NOTHING about size or whether
to trade -- it reports disagreements and lets the caller (pick.py / the loop) act. Fails closed:
any missing side, any unmatched market, any failed read yields no opportunity rather than a guess.
