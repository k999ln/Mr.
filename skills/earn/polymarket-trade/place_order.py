place_order.py — EXECUTION: generalized V2 FAK order placement (#25 spec §2.2).

The EXACT working path that used to live in v2_full_flow.py (SecureClient sig-3
credential bootstrap + relayer-key mint via SIWE + get_order_book +
create_market_order FAK + post_order), generalized so TOKEN_ID/SIDE/AMOUNT are
INPUTS, never hardcoded. v2_full_flow.py itself was DELETED (#25 adversary fix
#2) — it hardcoded a TID and was standalone-runnable, a footgun now that this
file supersedes it; nothing else imported/called it (verified via grep before
removal). WHICH market/side/amount is entirely pick.py's (the model's)
decision — this file only executes it and enforces the money-safety cap.

Inputs (env preferred, positional argv fallback):
  TOKEN_ID   CLOB token id to BUY                              (argv[1])
  SIDE       must be "BUY" — this flow only supports BUY;
             SELL needs shares already held, out of scope here (argv[2])
  AMOUNT     USD spend amount                                  (argv[3])
  POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY  this instance's signer key (read via the
                              agent's own .env, same as fund_via_bridge.py)
  MAX_BET_SIZE (default 2)   hard cap on AMOUNT (money-safety, not judgment)
  PM_TRADE_AGENT_HOME        override for the base agent home (default below)

Output: exactly one line of JSON on the REAL stdout (guaranteed clean — see below):
  {"token_id","amount","order_id","post_result","ok"}
On any failure before an order can be attempted: {"ok": false, "error": "..."}
(exit code 1). Never places a fake/simulated order — no dry-run path exists.

CLEAN-STDOUT GUARANTEE (#25 adversary fix, accounting integrity, 2026-07-05):
a real Franklin fill ("Will Jesus Christ return before GTA VI?", NO, ~$1,
CONFIRMED filled on-chain) was mis-logged ok:false by run.sh because the
polymarket SDK (imported inside main(), during mint/credential-bootstrap)
printed to stdout and merged onto the SAME line as the result JSON, breaking
run.sh's json.loads(). Fix: `sys.stdout` at process start is captured as
`_REAL_STDOUT` before anything runs; ALL work (SDK import, SIWE mint,
approve, order book, order placement) runs under
`contextlib.redirect_stdout(sys.stderr)`, so any stray SDK/library print
lands on stderr. The ONLY thing ever written to `_REAL_STDOUT` is the single
final `_emit(...)` call — stdout is guaranteed to be exactly one clean JSON
line, so a real fill is never again mis-recorded as a parse failure.
