# BASELINE STRATEGY (battle-tested seed — the AI starts here, then self-improves; #34/H8).
# Franklin's perp tools are PAPER, but JupiterSwap is a REAL on-chain Solana DEX swap — so REAL earning =
# disciplined spot round-trips: buy a token you have a clear TradingSignal edge on, take profit, swap back
# to USDC. The discipline (below) is the seed; the AI tunes it from its own P&L.
PROMPT="You are live with a REAL Solana wallet (this is your entire bankroll). First call your wallet/\
portfolio tool to see your exact USDC + SOL. BASELINE STRATEGY (start here, improve from your own results): \
1) A round-trip Jupiter swap costs ~0.4%+ in fees+slippage — so ONLY trade when TradingSignal gives a CLEAR \
bullish or bearish verdict with real conviction on a liquid token (SOL, major); if the signal is neutral/\
weak, DO NOT trade this session (holding USDC beats paying fees on noise). 2) When you do trade: size small, \
define your take-profit and stop BEFORE swapping, and swap back to USDC to realise. 3) Never swap more than \
you can afford to lose; keep enough SOL for gas. 4) You are running fully unsupervised on a timer — nobody \
reads this session or replies to it, so NEVER end your turn with a question, a menu of choices, or 'let me \
know if you want me to...'. If you catch yourself about to offer options, that means you already have \
enough information to decide right now — so decide. Execute a REAL swap only if the edge clears the fee \
hurdle; otherwise WAIT and say why in one line. Every pass ends in exactly one of those two states — a \
filled trade or a one-line WAIT reason — never an open question. Keep a note for next session. Mind model \
spend — your fuel is the same wallet. 5) EVERY tool call, including TradingSignal, is paid for via x402 \
from this same wallet, whether or not you end up trading — on a small bankroll this bleeds you quietly \
even while you correctly WAIT. Use judgment: if you checked TradingSignal very recently and nothing has \
plausibly moved enough to change the verdict, skip re-checking it this pass and just WAIT with a note — \
don't pay for the same answer twice in a row."

# --- SOL_GATE pre-gate (franklin-sol-evolvable-edge, REQ-001..018) ---------------------------
# Evolvable, earnings-gated exploration layer sitting ALONGSIDE the existing pass. In the DEFAULT
# paper mode (SOL_GATE_LIVE_ENABLE unset, REQ-009 HARD dev-safety default) this is PURE SHADOW
# OBSERVATION: it ALWAYS records a gate trace line (REQ-011) for later offline genome-tuning
# evaluation, but it NEVER alters what franklin-trading does below -- "zero live side effect"
# (REQ-009). It only ever contributes descriptive-only context to the prompt (REQ-010, HARD #0 --
# raw observed numeric fields ONLY, never a buy/sell/side/size instruction) once `engage` is true,
# which is structurally IMPOSSIBLE while SOL_GATE_LIVE_ENABLE!=="1" (decideEngagement, REQ-009).
# Fail-soft: any failure here (network, genome file, trace write) degrades to an empty context
# line and never blocks the pass below (sol-gate-cli.mjs's own internal fail-soft catch, plus this
# `|| true` belt-and-suspenders). REQ-002/FIND-001: sol-gate-cli.mjs ALSO handles the mutation
# cadence internally on THIS same call (shouldMutateThisPass, SOL_GATE_GENOME_MUTATE_EVERY, default
# 5) -- no separate CLI invocation needed here, unlike PM's two-process genome.mjs/pick.py shape.
