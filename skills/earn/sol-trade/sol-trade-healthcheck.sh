# DEPRECATED (self-heal-allslots sprint, FIND-006): this single-slot, sol-trade-hardcoded script is
# SUPERSEDED by the registry-driven generalization skills/self/earning-health-allslots.sh (which
# checks earn/sol-trade -- AND every other required earn slot -- via ONE shared script + one
# skills/self/earning-health-registry.json entry, reusing this file's exact detection algorithm
# unmodified via earning-health.py::is_fresh_but_barren). Kept in place, NOT deleted: the
# pre-existing ai.anicca.sol-trade-earning-healthcheck.plist may still reference this file until
# that plist is unloaded and migrated to ai.anicca.earning-health-allslots (see
# skills/self/launchd/README.md's explicit unload-before-load instruction; NEITHER plist is
# `launchctl load`ed by this sprint). Do not add new features here -- extend
# earning-health-allslots.sh + the registry instead; remove this file once the old plist is
# retired.
#
# sol-trade-healthcheck.sh — CONTENT check for the earn/sol-trade slot, NOT an artifact-age check.
# THE BLIND SPOT THIS CLOSES (Franklin, 2026-07-08 -> 2026-07-10, ~46h): sol-trade.trace.jsonl got a
# new line on EVERY wake (a fresh "skip" line, roughly hourly), so the existing artifact-AGE
# staleness check (healthcheck-lib.sh's OUT_STALE_HRS, FIND-009 step (d)) never fired -- the file
# kept looking "fresh" the entire time. The actual bug (a path resolution regression in run.sh made
# the identity-match guard reject every wake) only shows up if you read what the trace SAYS, not how
# recently it was touched. This script reads the content instead: if the last MIN_RUN wakes are ALL
# action=skip with the identical reason, the MECHANISM itself is broken (not the agent's trading
# judgment -- see earning-health.py's docstring) -> escalate to self-fix, same give-up path
# healthcheck-lib.sh's hc_run() step (d) and cadence-deadline-check.sh already use.
#
# Instance-agnostic by design: every path below is resolved RELATIVE TO THIS SCRIPT'S OWN location
# (mirrors run.sh's own $SKILL_DIR-relative STATE_DIR), so whichever copy of the repo this runs from
# (a dev checkout, or an ANICCA_HOME-rsynced deployment such as Franklin's ~/.blockrun) it checks ITS
# OWN adjacent trace/state -- never a different instance's absolute path baked into shared OSS code.
