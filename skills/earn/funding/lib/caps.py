    capital base, counted exactly once per broadcast tx.

    Two adversary-review findings (money-safety review, 2026-07-08) are encoded here:

    Finding C (cap over-consumption): `run.py` chains three hops -- withdraw (deposit wallet
    -> owner EOA), bridge (owner EOA -> founder Solana wallet), send_to_franklin (founder
    Solana wallet -> Franklin) -- for ONE logical "$X funded to Franklin" decision. An earlier
    version of this function summed 'sent' rows across all three steps from the shared ledger,
    so one $X seed consumed ~3x $X of cap headroom. The withdraw hop is the ONE point where
    money actually leaves claude-p's capital base (the 0x904B... deposit wallet); bridge and
    send_to_franklin only move that SAME already-withdrawn money onward across claude-p's/
    Franklin's own custody chain (0x810f -> BF9v -> Franklin), so they are not a second or
    third real outflow from claude-p capital. Filtering to `step == "withdraw"` is the
    simplest fix that makes the cap match its documented meaning ("actual outflow from
    claude-p capital, once per seed") without weakening protection: all three scripts share
    this same function and the same ledger file, so bridge.py/send_to_franklin.py's own
    `check_caps` calls see the identical withdraw-only total as withdraw.py's.

    Finding A (crash-before-confirm): a tx that was broadcast but crashed before its
    confirmation could be recorded may already have moved real money, so a 'pending' row
    (written immediately after broadcast, before waiting for confirmation) must still consume
    cap headroom -- otherwise a subsequent run would not see money that already moved and
    could permit a further real transfer that, combined with the untracked one, exceeds the
    intended caps. When the same tx_hash later gets a terminal 'sent' row (confirmation
    succeeded), only the single most-terminal row for that tx_hash is counted, so one real
    transfer is never double-counted. Rows with no tx_hash (e.g. legacy rows, or any future
    status-only bookkeeping) are each counted individually, matching the original behavior.
