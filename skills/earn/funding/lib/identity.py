proxy 直近再起動で wallet を `8Fpqd` でなく `Efpap5` 表示 = identity 要確認"). A dashboard/proxy
can DISPLAY a different address after a restart; trusting that display string instead of the
actual key material could misdirect real funds. This module always derives the recipient's
PUBLIC address from its OWN key/session file and cross-checks it against a known-good address
from config -- never trusts a banner/label alone.

Everything here is either pure (no I/O) or reads only a local key file to derive a PUBLIC
address; it never returns or logs the secret itself.
