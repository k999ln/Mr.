"""Write the apply lane's ledger row from the model's structured report, in code.

X8b (2026-07-27). Measured: applied.jsonl held 224 rows and only 27 carried a
category (12%). category_bandit's arm is the category, so with no category there is
no arm -- the identity chain landed two payments on real applications
(observation_by_stage.paid=2) and the bandit still saw by_stage.paid=0, because both
rows had category=None. Every learner downstream (bandit, EVAL, keep/revert) was
optimising against a reward it structurally could not observe.

The cause was not a bug in the bandit. It was that no line of code had ever recorded
what an application WAS. gig_pass.sh does not contain the word "category"; the B2 step
prompt carried no field contract, so the ledger row was composed freehand by the model
and its shape drifted (price_jpy/price_proposed, ts/applied_at, evidence/evidence_dir).
The one artifact that did hold categories, ~/gig/_b2_candidates.json, was a model
output no code reads or writes, and it stopped on 7/20.

The fix follows the same rule as listing_ledger and lane_productivity: THE MODEL
REPORTS, THE CODE WRITES THE LEDGER. Under strict structured outputs the B2-only
schema carries a required-but-nullable `applications` array; this module turns its
rows into ledger rows.

Three properties make the resulting number trustworthy rather than merely present:

1. It cannot invent an application. A reported application is written only when the
   pass left a "<requestId>-submitted.png" behind -- the same proof normalize_applied
   requires, taken after the submission is visible on screen. An unproven report is
   counted, never written.

2. It cannot invent a category. A missing category is stored as null, and the gap
   shows up in category_bandit's coverage rather than being filled by a guess.

3. It records WHERE the category came from. category_source is "dom" when it was read
   off the page snapshot and "agent" when it is the model's own claim, so a later
   reader can discount self-report. Note as of 2026-07-27 no snapshot carries a
   category at all: cdp_nav_snapshot.py writes only {url,not_found,observed,title}, so
   every real row will be "agent" until that observation is added. The dom path is
   implemented and tested so the day it appears it wins automatically.

4. A silent model cannot erase a real browser side effect. Fresh
   "gig-*-B2-<requestId>-submitted.png" evidence recovers a minimal application row
   with category=None. b2_result_gate then rejects the contradictory model result,
   while the recovered identity makes the retry dedupe-safe.

Division of labour with normalize_applied.py: that module REPAIRS rows the model wrote
itself (fills ts, promotes status) and never adds a row. This module ADDS the reported
row, recovers a minimal proof-only row, or enriches an existing row that is missing a
category. It runs first, so anything it writes is already well-formed and the
normalizer has nothing to fix.
