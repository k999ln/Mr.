"""Bound the evidence the gig loop writes, so a human never cleans this disk again.

WHY (measured against live ~/gig on 2026-07-30, before any policy existed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ~/gig/evidence   693 MB in 247 dirs + 114 loose files, grown in 2.1 days
                     => ~330 MB/day, unbounded.  Nothing in the loop deletes
                        anything the loop writes.  It filled the disk, a sentinel
                        raised a hard stop, and the loop was dead ~10 hours.

    PNG              3129 files, 619.5 MB = 89% of every evidence byte.
      inside pass dirs:
        PROOF  png    167 files,  27.6 MB  submitted/form/readback
        BROWSE png   2803 files, 561.4 MB  every request page the apply lane looked at

    gig-pass-*        57 dirs, 645 MB   (43 FAILED / 10 SUCCESS / 4 unknown)
    reply-detector-* 176 dirs, 1.5 MB, zero PNGs

The dominant lever is therefore the BROWSE screenshot -- 81% of all bytes, and
nothing ever reads one back.  It is NOT "failed vs successful pass": failed passes
are 75% of the corpus, so discarding only successful passes' screenshots would
reclaim 24%, not 81%.

DESIGN (copied from proven external implementations, not invented here)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * High/low watermark with hysteresis, not a binary stop
        kubernetes/kubernetes pkg/kubelet/images/image_gc_manager.go
        openclaw/openclaw     src/config/sessions/disk-budget.ts
    Start collecting above `high_water_bytes`, evict oldest-first by mtime, stop
    at `low_water_bytes`, resume work.  Never collect below high.
  * Dual bound: count AND bytes, and always keep at least one
        Dicklesworthstone/claude_code_agent_farm _cleanup_old_backups
  * Tiered retention expressed as data, not code branches
        restic/restic internal/data/snapshot_policy.go ExpirePolicy{Last, Daily}
    keep last N, plus the newest survivor of each of the last M days.
  * Real runs partitioned from no-op ticks so no-ops cannot evict real history
        openclaw/openclaw src/tasks/cron-history-retention.ts
    Each partition owns an independent count budget; 288 reply-detector ticks a
    day can never push out a gig-pass.
  * The sweeper lives in the runtime and self-schedules; it is not a new cron
        Arize-ai/phoenix src/phoenix/server/retention.py TraceDataSweeper
    Called once per pass from gig_pass.sh and again from the hourly auditor.

SAFETY (hard, and each one has a test)
--------------------------------------
  * Structural: this only ever walks `evidence_root`.  It REFUSES to run at all if
    that root contains `projects/` or `deliverables/`, or resolves to the state
    dir -- so a misconfigured GIG_EVIDENCE_ROOT cannot reach client deliverables.
  * Never deletes a file matching PROTECTED_GLOBS: ledgers (*.jsonl), databases
    (*.sqlite3*), archives, and every application-proof artefact.  The proof set
    is not cosmetic: normalize_applied._evidence_ids and
    application_report._proven_ids glob `*-B2-*-submitted.png` off the evidence
    ROOT to prove an application really happened and to heal the ledger.
  * Never deletes evidence pinned by an unresolved record: `.last-pass`, live
    lane locks, open rows in gig-control.sqlite3 repair_queue, or recent paths
    named by pass-failures.jsonl, report-envelopes.jsonl, and applied.jsonl.
  * Never deletes the currently running pass's own evidence dir.
  * Crash-safe: a directory is renamed into `<name>.gc-trash.<pid>` first, then
    unlinked.  A killed sweeper leaves only trash, which the next run reaps.
  * Never fatal: every failure is swallowed and reported in the result.  The CLI
    always exits 0 -- same contract as the reporting path.
