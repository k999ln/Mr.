"""Keep what we said to a buyer, next to what they said to us.

On 2026-08-06 two conversations explained the entire difference between revenue and
silence: one answered "可能です" and gated the work on purchase and closed; the other
promised to send the deliverable for free and the buyer went quiet. The loop could read
neither. connector_intents stores only outgoing_hash, reply-lane-result.json has no body,
and pre-purchase DMs were persisted nowhere -- so "learn from the conversations that won"
was not a hard problem, it was an impossible one.

Pure functions. The caller supplies everything; nothing here touches a browser or a queue.
