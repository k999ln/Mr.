# gig_brake.sh — the operator brake for the gig loop.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-07, two failures in twenty minutes):
#
#   23:39  An operator wrote a stop reason into configured runtime state/state/disk-writers.stop,
#          the flag launch_gig_worker.sh already honours. It was gone in ~60s.
#          disk-sentinel.sh:277-279 clears that flag whenever free space recovers.
#          That flag does not mean "stop"; it means "the disk is full", and it has
#          an owner (disk-sentinel) that clears it on ITS OWN schedule. Borrowing
#          another controller's flag means borrowing its clear condition.
#
#   23:50  The operator booted the pass out of launchd. launchctl showed it gone.
#          Five minutes later it was running: gig-healthcheck.sh -> plist-selfheal.sh
#          reconciles any hf-gig label that is installed-but-not-loaded back into
#          launchd every 300s. That guard is correct and must keep working.
#
# THE RULE THIS FILE ENCODES:
#   A brake holds only if nothing else manages it. So this flag has
#     (a) its own path, under a name no other job greps for,
#     (b) a recorded owner -- the human or agent who raised it -- and
#     (c) exactly one clear condition: that owner releases it, or the expiry that
#         same owner set at raise time elapses.
#   Nothing clears it for a reason unrelated to why it was raised. Free disk,
#   recovered heartbeats, plist reconciliation: none of them touch it.
#
# AND THE COUNTERWEIGHT:
#   A brake that can be forgotten is how earning dies quietly. disk-sentinel.sh:271-276
#   records the 2026-07-30 outage precisely: a stop flag latched at a clear point the
#   machine could not reach, with nothing but one log line per hour. Ten hours.
#   Two properties were BOTH required for that: unbounded hold, and silence.
#   So this brake removes both --
#     * bounded: expiry is mandatory, defaulted to 60min and capped at 480min, i.e.
#       strictly shorter than the incident it is preventing. Renewal is one command.
#     * loud: every refusal notifies, and gig-healthcheck.sh re-announces a held brake
#       every GIG_BRAKE_ALARM_MINUTES (default 30) for as long as it is held.
#   Expiry is not "something else managing it": it is a term the owner wrote down
#   themselves. That is the whole difference from the disk flag.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED ON DAMAGE: a brake file that is unreadable or malformed still blocks.
# Someone meant to stop the loop. The expiry safeguard is synthesised from the file
# mtime so even a corrupt brake cannot become an unbounded outage.
#
# Sourceable as a library, or run directly as a CLI:
#   gig_brake.sh raise --owner NAME --reason TEXT [--ttl-minutes N]
#   gig_brake.sh renew [--ttl-minutes N]
#   gig_brake.sh release --owner NAME
#   gig_brake.sh status          # exit 0 = held (loop must not run), 1 = not held
#   gig_brake.sh alarm           # re-announce a held brake / reap an expired one
#
# Test overrides: GIG_OPERATOR_BRAKE_FILE, GIG_BRAKE_LOG, GIG_BRAKE_NOTIFY_CMD,
#                 GIG_BRAKE_ALARM_MINUTES, GIG_BRAKE_TELEGRAM.
