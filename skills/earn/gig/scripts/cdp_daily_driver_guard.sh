# cdp_daily_driver_guard.sh — deterministic health-check + auto-recover for the SHARED CloakBrowser
# daily-driver (CDP :9222). Root-caused 2026-07-13: after many hours of continuous automation (gig
# core B1/B2 passes + hourly reality-verifier + other loops), the daily-driver's tabs/renderer
# processes accumulate (observed: 100+ chromium helper processes, several pinned at 20-98% CPU) until
# the root Chromium process is so starved it stops even ACCEPTING new TCP connections on its own
# LISTEN socket (confirmed: `lsof -iTCP:9222 -sTCP:LISTEN` shows it bound, but `curl`/raw `nc` connects
# time out at the TCP handshake — not an HTTP-level error, a kernel-accept-queue-never-drained one).
# Every downstream reality-verify round then fails with evidence_captured=0 (CDP unreachable), which
# is indistinguishable from a stale/wrong claim unless you look at the raw judge output — so gig
# claims "look unconfirmed" for an infra reason, not a grounding-discipline reason.
#
# This is deterministic infra bookkeeping (process health + restart), not judgment — no site/DOM
# decision is made here (mirrors cdp_lock.sh's existing precedent for infra-only bash in this dir).
#
# Usage: source this file, then call: cdp_guard_ensure_healthy [probe_timeout_secs] [relaunch_wait_secs]
#   Returns 0 if the daily-driver answers /json/version by the time it returns (healthy, or
#   successfully recovered). Returns 1 only if a relaunch was attempted and it STILL doesn't answer
#   (caller should treat this round as a genuine defer/fail, not retry-loop forever).
