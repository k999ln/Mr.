"""Which paid orders may this pass work, and which are skipped over.

★ Priority decides the order things are fetched in. It must not decide whether
anything proceeds. ★

River (riverqueue.com/docs/pro/concurrency-limits, fetched 2026-08-08) states the
rule this module implements, verbatim:

    "any job that _would_ be fetched based on normal prioritization will be
     skipped over if working it would exceed a concurrency limit."

and names the partition this module applies:

    "A common use case is to partition by customer or tenant, allowing each to
     have an independent concurrency limit"

Measured 2026-08-08 05:47 on the live loop, which had neither::

    12 consecutive passes: queue top = 91000001, FIRST_CONTACT redirect -> ask,
                           "no question sent (nothing new to ask)", pass ends
    91000002 (a different paying customer, v5 built and sitting on disk since
             22:07) last selected 22:03 -- eight hours untouched
    STEP B2 skipped (policy B2:unresolved_higher_priority_queue:...:91000001)

One order that could not move stopped a second customer's finished work and all
new-customer intake. This module removes the property that made that fatal: an
order that cannot move is skipped over, and the next one is worked.


What "cannot proceed" means, and why it is read from the ledger
---------------------------------------------------------------

★ It is not re-derived from the pass's control flow. ★ Predicting "this order
will no-op" by re-implementing the dispatch conditions would be a second copy of
a 300-line bash decision tree, wrong the day either copy changes. What is read
instead is the record the loop already writes about itself:
``~/gig/projects/<identity>/events.jsonl``.

``record_queue_selection`` appends ``queue_selected`` every time the pass picks
an order. Anything the pass then achieves appends its own event
(``paid_work_ready_for_browser``, ``FORMAL_DELIVERY_INTENT``,
``paid_answer_browser_sent_reconciled``, ...). So a run of ``queue_selected``
rows with no other event between them is, literally, "we picked this order N
times and nothing happened" -- whatever the cause. The live ledger for 91000001
ends in eight such rows; 91000002's ends in a real event.

★ The unknown-event direction is deliberate. ★ ``INERT_EVENTS`` is a denylist,
not an allowlist: an event this module has never heard of counts as progress and
keeps the order eligible. The two possible mistakes are not symmetric -- skipping
an order that was fine is a paying customer left unserved, while continuing to
work one that is stuck is only today's behaviour, which the rest of the pass
already survives. So the fail-safe direction is "assume it moved".


Starvation in the other direction
---------------------------------

Skipping is cheap, so a permanently-stuck order would otherwise be skipped
forever and quietly abandoned -- the same silence with a different shape. Two
bounds, both counted off the same ledger:

* ``probe_every`` (default 6, i.e. ~6 hourly passes): the order is admitted
  anyway, once. A jam that healed itself out of band is picked up within six
  hours at a cost of one pass; a jam that has not healed writes one more
  ``queue_selected`` and goes back to being skipped.
* ``escalate_at`` (default 12, ~12 hours): an escalation row is written to
  ``~/gig/paid-lane-escalations.jsonl`` and the caller records a typed pass
  failure. Twelve hours is chosen against the clock that actually matters --
  Coconala cancels an unanswered order at 48 hours -- so escalation lands with
  three quarters of the window still open.

Neither bound is a model call and neither needs a new state store.

#   - NOT the wall clock. GIG_PASS_WALL_CLOCK_LIMIT_SECONDS=3480 against
#     measured pass durations of 60-1013s over the last twelve passes.
#   - NOT the model budget. GIG_MODEL_CALL_LIMIT=7; a paid order costs at

# so it is decisions[0] and takes the only max_orders=1 slot -- for every pass in the
# window, while a second customer's finished artifact sits untouched, the only alarm
# being the STARVED order escalating twelve hours later.
#
# But the obvious bound is unreachable exactly when it is needed. Counting off
# ``selections_without_progress`` was measured wrong on 91000001 the day it shipped:
# that counter stood at 10 and nothing ever decrements it -- only a real event resets
# it, and the failure mode IS that no real event happens. So the override would have
# been reachable only for an order that became at-risk while stalled 2 or 3, and for
# the deeply-stuck order it exists for it bought zero passes, forever.
#
# ★ The honest boundary is the window itself. ★ The ledger records no risk-onset field
# -- ``record_queue_selection`` (delivery_project.py:56,72) stores neither
# ``contact_deadline`` nor ``first_contact_at_risk`` in the row state, verified on the
# live ledger -- so there is nothing to read that dates the onset directly. What there
# IS: every row carries ``ts`` (project_ledger.py:43), and this module's own definition
# of "at risk enough to override" is "the deadline is inside the window". Those give a
# derived instant that is not a proxy for anything: window entry = deadline - window.
# Selections made after it are the passes the deadline has already bought.
#
# So a deeply-stuck order gets its full allowance the moment its clock enters the
# window, however long it sat stuck beforehand -- 91000001 has 0 selections after its
# 2026-08-08T23:00+09:00 entry -- and an order that has burned the allowance inside the
# window stops holding the slot. With a real bound the window size stops being the

    Pure: reads ledgers, writes nothing. ``items`` must already be in the queue's
    own priority order. Priority still decides which item is *looked at* first and,
    among items that are all otherwise eligible, still breaks ties -- but it does not
    decide who wins the shared slot outright. See "round robin" below for why.

    ``now`` is the instant the deadline window is measured against. Unset, it is read
    from the item's ``snapshot_captured_at`` -- ``delivery_queue`` deliberately uses
    the snapshot's capture instant, the honest now, being the moment the banner was
    actually read -- and only then from the machine clock. A machine clock that has
    run past a deadline the snapshot saw as live would otherwise disable the override
    silently and let the order die quietly.

    ★ Round robin: who gets the shared slot(s) when more than one order is eligible. ★
    A genuinely stuck order (rule 1, above) is decided on its own -- it is skipped for
    ``REASON_NO_PROGRESS`` regardless of what else is going on, because it could not
    proceed even with a free slot. Everything else competes for the ``max_orders``
    slots, and that competition is NOT run in priority order: it runs least-recently-
    admitted first. An order that has never won the slot (``last_admitted_ts == 0.0``)
    always outranks one that has, and orders tied on that (typically every order this
    module has never admitted) fall back to priority via the original index.

    This is the reason: with the shipped ``max_orders=1``, pure priority order means
    whichever order sits at the top of the queue wins the slot every single pass for as
    long as it keeps making *some* progress -- it is never "stuck" by rule 1's
    definition, so nothing before this change ever let a second, lower-priority order
    through. That is D1 in 26-gig-loop-asis-tobe-plan.md: "max_orders=1 head-of-line
    blocking means ONE order monopolizes the paid lane while others wait." Least-
    recently-admitted-first turns that into strict alternation: a customer who just won
    the slot yields it to whoever has been waiting longest, and is eligible again next
    time nobody has waited longer.

    River's actual fix (35-gig-no-head-of-line-blocking-design.md rule 2: "1 pass
    processes multiple orders, N slots overall") is not this. Widening ``max_orders``
    needs the paid-lane evidence namespace to be per-order first -- see the comment on
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_ORDERS`` for the concrete failure mode (a second order's answer
    overwriting or becoming unrecoverable, which risks sending one buyer the message
    composed for another). This function does not touch that. Strict rotation with
    ``max_orders`` unchanged already removes the starvation -- "the same order every
    pass, forever" becomes "alternates pass to pass" -- without opening that risk.
