"""Read what Dais actually said, from the Telegram Web tab that is already logged in.

Three attempts on 2026-08-06 concluded this was impossible. Each was wrong, and each was
wrong for the same reason -- a refusal from one entrance was read as a wall:

  openclaw message read   Unsupported Telegram action: read   (the gateway owns that token)
  getUpdates              Conflict: webhook is active         (Rockstar_ibot owns that one)
  cookie inspection       0 rows for telegram                 (the session lives in IndexedDB)

The daily-driver profile is logged in. So the text is readable with no token at all, and
without touching either receive path that production depends on.

Two facts here were measured rather than assumed, and both cost a round trip to learn:

``.chatlist-chat`` is the row, not ``ul.chatlist li`` -- that selector belongs to an older
build of the client and matches nothing today.

**A chat only opens on a real mouse event.** ``element.click()`` and ``location.hash = ...``
both leave the message pane empty; the client's router does not listen to either. The
caller must dispatch ``Input.dispatchMouseEvent`` at the row's centre.

This reader does **not** exist to ask permission. The loop's whole value is that it earns
with no human in it, and a send that waits for a reply is a send that never happens on a
workday; what a message may contain is decided by ``followup_draft.check_draft``, which is
code and answers instantly. Reading runs the other direction -- picking up an instruction
Dais typed on his own ("this thread is dead, stop") without him having to be asked.

Orientation of authorship is the opposite of the naive reading: the browser is logged in as
Dais, so ``is-out`` marks *Dais's* messages, and the bot's replies are incoming. A caller
that got this backwards would obey the loop's own report as if Dais had written it, so
``owner`` is attached here rather than left to the caller's memory.
