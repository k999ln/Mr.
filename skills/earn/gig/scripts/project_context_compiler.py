"""Compile one durable, request-scoped project context without raw-history stuffing.

Until 2026-08-07 this compiled *references*: paths, byte counts and hashes for everything
under ``source/``, ``requirements/``, ``delivery/`` and ``acceptance/``. It ran every
pass, wrote ``context/current.json`` and a receipts ledger, and ★nothing read either file
back★. Meanwhile ``artifact_judge.py`` read the entire talkroom ledger, so the judge saw
more of the order than the builder did -- the builder got a path string in its packet.

So the same compiler now carries content as well as references, from all four places a
requirement can be written:

| source | why it is here |
|---|---|
| ``source/posting/`` | what the buyer wrote before paying (91000002: 枚数 4枚) |
| ``source/proposal/`` | what the seller offered before the buyer purchased |
| ``source/dm/`` | the thread the material arrived in, plus its attachment index |
| ``requirements/live-buyer-reply.json`` | the current request AND everything accumulated |
| our own messages | on 2026-08-06 15:46 we promised this buyer a draft and forgot |

★Index and salient content travel; bodies stay as file references.★ ``read_these_first``
names the files, every section carries its own path, and the whole block is bounded to
``COMBINED_MAX_BYTES`` -- a builder that needs a full body reads the path.
