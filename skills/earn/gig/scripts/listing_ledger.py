"""listing_ledger.py -- the single source of truth for "how many listings do we have".

Why this exists: on 2026-07-27 one JST day had three answers -- 日報=7, funnel=4,
台帳=11 -- because three systems each invented their own projection over the same
file, ~/gig/shuppin.jsonl:

  日報   len([row for row in shuppin if action == "shuppin_published"])   -> 7
         publish *rows*, no dedup. Service 94000016 was republished four times, so
         one listing was reported as four.
  funnel len({service_id where action == "shuppin_published"})            -> 4
         distinct published ids -- correct, but with a silent fallback to
         "distinct id ever seen" when nothing was published, so the same field
         could mean two different things on different days.
  台帳   distinct service_id tokens anywhere in the file                  -> 11
         includes drafts, blocked attempts, the literal string "N/A", and one
         cell holding six comma-joined ids.

strategy.json keep/revert and the X8 bandit consume these numbers as a learning
signal, so three answers means the loop optimises against a quantity that does not
exist. This module owns the taxonomy; the three systems import it and are forbidden
from re-deriving counts themselves.

TAXONOMY (explicit, shared, and the only place these decisions are made)

  identity   A listing is identified by its coconala service_id. The ledger is
             agent-written free text, so an id cell may be a placeholder ("N/A"),
             or several ids joined by commas. Placeholders are not listings;
             a comma-joined cell is several listings, not one.

  kind       published  shuppin_published  -- the listing is publicly live
             created    shuppin_created    -- draft exists, NOT live
             blocked    shuppin_blocked    -- the attempt failed, nothing exists
             archived   shuppin_archived   -- was live, taken down (listing_archive.py);
                        nets OUT of published_listings so a delisted id does not count
                        forever (C3, 2026-08-09: this was the second half of the
                        7-vs-4-vs-11 drift class -- C1's inventory found 16 ledger
                        "published" ids against 10 actually live)
             touched    everything else (edited/reviewed/checked/audit/...) --
                        proves the listing exists, proves nothing about state

  dedup      Counts of *listings* are over distinct service_id. Counts of *events*
             are over rows. Both are exposed under names that say which they are, so
             no caller can pick up one while meaning the other -- that confusion is
             precisely the 7-vs-4 gap.

  identity-gated
             A publish row with no usable service_id cannot be deduplicated, so it
             is never folded into published_listings. It is surfaced as
             unidentified_publish_events so the ambiguity stays visible instead of
             inflating the total. This is the evidence gate: an agent's unverifiable
             self-report must not be able to raise the headline number.

  time       ts is agent-written and appears as epoch int, epoch float, numeric
             string, or ISO 8601 (with Z, with offset, or naive). All are parsed.
             (The old 台帳 counter used isinstance(ts, (int, float)) and silently
             dropped 26 of 104 live rows.) A row whose ts cannot be parsed is
             counted only in unbounded queries and reported as undated_events.

  day        Natural day = JST calendar day, [00:00:00, next 00:00:00) at UTC+9.
             The daily report fires at 09:07 JST and reports the day it names in
             its header, not a rolling 24h window off wall-clock UTC.

Contract: read-only, never fatal. A missing or corrupt ledger yields zeros. This is
a counter; it must never fail a pass that did customer work.
