"""One question, asked by someone who did not write the answer.

2026-08-07. Three times in one day the paid builder produced the same kind of thing --
a document *about* the order rather than the thing the order bought -- and three times
its own acceptance said PASS.

    v2  1879B  「ご依頼内容の確認資料」          ★delivered to the buyer★
    v3  2154B  「まず確認する場所 / 1. 取引トークルームを開きます」   quarantined by accident
    v3  2173B  「ご依頼内容の確認資料（更新版）」  committed as current_version, armed

Only Coconala's refusal to accept a second formal delivery while one awaits confirmation
kept the third from the buyer. That is an accident, not a defence.

★ Prohibition failed three times because prohibition is enumeration. ★ The builder's
prompt was given the ban in general terms, then with the observed shape named outright
(「ファイルの開き方を説明する文書を作るな」); ``PAID_WORK.prompt.txt`` greps confirm it
arrived. It read the ban and reworded the document. A list of forbidden forms can always
be stepped around; a judgement about the *nature* of the thing cannot.

★ 2026-08-07 23:36, order 91000001: the question itself was too narrow. ★ The buyer bought
「ポケモン動画の企画・台本作成」. The builder, having never spoken to them, produced
``sample-game-guide-v1.docx`` -- a competent general guide to the game, subtitled
「ゲーム紹介・記事作成用 基礎資料」. Acceptance said PASS and ★this judge said ok★, and the
formal-delivery browser was one step from sending it.

Two separate things let that through, and the second is the one the incident report missed:

1. The question was "is this *about the deal*?" -- and it was not. It was a real work
   product. It simply was not the one that was bought. A yes/no on meta-documents cannot
   express "wrong thing", so the only answer left was ``deliverable``.
2. ★ The judge never asked anything at all. ★ ``.docx`` is a zip container, so
   ``artifact_body`` returned ``binary`` and ``run_judge`` short-circuited to
   ``deliverable`` before the order text was even looked at -- zero model calls. The
   comment that used to sit on that branch predicted this exact case and called it a
   "known and accepted gap ... no such instance has been observed". Tonight was the
   instance. Widening it needed a text extractor, and now there is one: OOXML is a zip of
   XML, and ``stdlib zipfile`` reads it.

So the question is now ★「この成果物は、この買い手が注文した物か」★, and the answers are:

    deliverable        the thing the buyer bought
    about_the_deal     a document about the transaction (the 2026-08-07 15:00 shape)
    not_the_order      a real work product, but not the one that was bought (23:36)
    needs_buyer_input  the order never said what to make -- ★ask, do not stop★
    undeterminable     our own view of the artifact is too poor to say

★ needs_buyer_input is not a refusal. ★ 26-gig-loop-asis-tobe-plan §3: a judge that refuses
more often is not a better judge, it is a loop that earns nothing. Three exits exist and
only the third is failure -- deliver when it matches, ask when the order is underspecified,
refuse when it is genuinely wrong. The two axes are kept apart on purpose:
``needs_buyer_input`` says the *order* is deficient, ``undeterminable`` says our *view of
the artifact* is.

★ It is given the buyer's own messages and the artifact's own bytes. ★ Not the manifest,
not the acceptance evidence, not the builder's summary. The contradiction check added
earlier the same day failed for exactly that reason: it read
``evidence/acceptance-blocked.json``, a file the builder writes, so a builder that never
declares a block leaves the check with nothing to look at. A check whose input is the
suspect's own testimony is not a check.

Scope discipline (see 31-gig-todo10 §2.2, §3): ★still one question, asked once★. No quality
score, no rewrite suggestion, no second job in the prompt, no follow-up turn. The answer set
grew because the old one had nowhere to put "wrong thing" and nowhere to put "nobody said
what the thing was"; the question did not.

    then ``queue_item.title`` -- the marketplace order label, ★the only carrier a direct
    offer has★. The first two legs are ``posting_text`` above, which this module already had.
    This is the third, and without it the judge is blind in exactly the way the builder was:
    for 91000001 ``posting_text`` returns "" (re-measured 2026-08-08 -- ``~/gig/postings``
    holds 43 postings and ``request-91000001.json`` is not among them, and that project has no
    ``source/posting/`` either, because the order arrived as ``offer:92000015`` and nothing was
    ever applied to), so the words 企画 and 台本 reached neither end of the loop. B6 measured
    ``source/posting/`` in 1 of 9 live projects.

    ★Where the label is read from, and why it is not a new parameter.★ The judge's callers
    hand it ``project_root``, ``artifact_path`` and ``requirements_path`` -- there is no queue
    item in its signature, and ``first_contact.py`` gets one only because gig_pass.sh passes
    ``--queue-item`` to it explicitly. Rather than add an argument that every existing caller
    (both browsers, ``_main``, every test) would have to be edited to fill, this reads the
    file those callers were themselves handed: gig_pass.sh writes the selected row to
    ``$EVIDENCE_DIR/paid-queue-expected.json`` (gig_pass.sh:1899 and :2376) and passes that
    path to the progress browser and to the formal browser (:1928, :2389, :2401), and the
    judge runs inside those browsers. ★The invariant, not the count★: every queue item on
    disk carries a non-empty ``title``. Held 36 of 36 at 08:38 on 2026-08-08 and 35 of 35 at
    08:56, the difference being the evidence GC rather than a row without a title.

    ★Not the project's own copy of the same fact, on purpose.★ ``<root>/context/current.json``
    also carries ``combined_context.order.title`` after A9, by a single deterministic path --
    but it sits inside ``--workdir``, the builder's writable tree, so the agent whose artifact
    is being judged could rewrite the order it is judged against. The pass evidence directory
    is outside it. That is the same reason the verdict cache lives under ``~/.local/state``.

    Identity is ``request_id`` with ``talkroom_id`` as the fallback, which is

【問い】この成果物は、この買い手が注文した物ですか。

答えは次の5つのうち1つだけです。
- deliverable: 買い手が注文した物である。買い手はこれを受け取るために代金を払った。
- about_the_deal: 取引そのものについて書かれた文書。確認資料、要件の整理、進捗や状況の説明、確認場所や手順の案内、質問状、計画書などが該当する。買い手が注文した物ではない。
- not_the_order: それ自体は本物の制作物だが、注文された物とは種類が違う。注文が求めた成果物の種類（例: 企画、台本、デザイン、コード、記事）と、この成果物の種類が一致しない場合がこれにあたる。題材や話題が合っていても、成果物の種類が違えば not_the_order です。
- needs_buyer_input: ★注文の側に、何を作るべきかが書かれていない。★ 与えられた記録には題材・分野・納品形式などはあるが、どういう成果物を作るのかが述べられていない。この場合、成果物の良し悪しは判定できない。買い手に質問する必要がある。
- undeterminable: 注文は十分に述べられているが、こちらが見ている成果物の中身が乏しすぎて（抜粋が短い、内容が読み取れない等）判定できない。

★2つの「決められない」を取り違えないでください。★
needs_buyer_input は★注文★が足りない場合です。undeterminable は★成果物の見え方★が足りない場合です。
注文に「何を作るか」が書かれていないなら、成果物がどれほど立派でも deliverable ではありません。needs_buyer_input を選んでください。買い手に質問することは失敗ではなく、正しい前進です。

★記録の読み方（ここを誤ると、正しい納品を止めてしまいます）★
- 募集時の投稿は求人広告です。そこにある「業務内容」は一般的な募集条件であり、この注文の成果物の題材・内容を限定するものではありません。募集文が成果物の題材に触れていないことは、不一致の根拠になりません。
- 後から述べられた具体的な指示（ダイレクトメッセージ、トークルーム）が、募集文の一般的な記述に優先します。買い手が個別に指定した内容が、この注文の実際の中身です。
- ★記録の中で、買い手がこの成果物を既に見て了承している、あるいはこの成果物に対する部分的な修正を依頼しているなら、それは注文された物です。deliverable を選んでください。★ 修正のやり取りが続いていること自体は、成果物が別物であることを意味しません。
- not_the_order を選ぶには「注文は A を求めたが、これは B である」と具体的に言えなければなりません。言えないなら not_the_order ではありません。

★判断は「性質」で行ってください。言い回し、見出し、体裁の違いで判断しないでください。★
同じ性質の文書が、表現だけを変えて繰り返し提出されています。次は実際に提出されたものの冒頭です。

{_ABOUT_THE_DEAL_EXAMPLE}

これは例です。この文面と一致するかどうかで判断しないでください。一致しなくても、性質が同じなら about_the_deal です。

必ず次の順に自問してください。順番を入れ替えないでください。

1. これは取引の進め方、確認方法、要件の整理、進捗の説明、計画、質問状のたぐいの文書か。
   ★この判定に注文の内容は必要ありません。★ 注文が何であれ、またどれほど注文の記録が乏しくても、
   この種の文書が納品物であることはありません。該当するなら about_the_deal。
   ★注文が分からないことを理由に、この判定を避けて needs_buyer_input を選ばないでください。★
2. 買い手はこの成果物を既に見て了承しているか、これに対する部分的な修正を依頼しているか。はいなら deliverable。
3. 記録のどこかに「何を作るか」が書かれているか。募集文の一般論ではなく、この注文に固有の指示として。
   書かれていなければ needs_buyer_input。
4. 書かれているなら、この成果物はその種類の物か。「A を求めたが B である」と具体的に言えるなら not_the_order。
5. どれでもないなら deliverable。

    verdict the builder could write is a verdict the builder could forge -- which is the
    failure this whole module exists to stop.

    ★ A gate placed on a state transition misses everything that already crossed. ★

    The first placement of this judge was inside ``validate_and_promote``, which is where
    an artifact becomes deliverable. That is a transition, and it is the wrong object to
    guard. Measured on the live pass of 2026-08-07 15:00 (evidence
    gig-pass-1786082405-78147): the queue row for order 91000002 arrived with
    ``delivery_action=formal`` and ``artifact_path=.../delivery-v3.md``; gig_pass.sh:2259
    skips ``run_paid_work`` entirely when the action is already ``formal``, so neither
    ``validate-promote`` (gig_pass.sh:1889) nor ``--mark-ready`` (gig_pass.sh:1943) ran --
    that pass produced no PAID_WORK.prompt.txt, no agent-PAID_WORK/ and no
    paid-work-transaction.json -- while gig_pass.sh:2276 still ran ``assess_paid_queue``
    and handed the artifact to the delivery browser. v3 had been promoted at 13:04, before
    the gate existed, so it walked past a gate guarding a door it had already come through.
    The judge was invoked zero times in that pass.

    ★ Gate the action, not the transition. ★ This runs immediately before the browser is
    launched, on the artifact the browser is about to attach, resolved from the manifest
    the browser is about to use -- never from a verdict cached in project state, which is
    the builder's own writable tree.

    The normal case is free: when the same pass promoted this artifact, the judge already
    answered about these exact bytes and the content-addressed cache replies without a
    model call. Only the pre-existing-artifact case -- precisely the one that got past --
    pays for a call.

    ★ Fails CLOSED, same direction and same error ids as validate_paid_work. ★ The
    question here is "may I send this to the buyer?", so anything short of a definite yes
    raises. A judge that raises is a judge that has cleared nothing.

    ``trajectory_context`` (EV1, spec §4.1) carries ``{"stage": ..., "lane": ...,
    "resource_key": "talkroom:<id>"}`` from whichever browser is about to send. It is
    recorded HERE rather than at the two call sites because this function already owns the
    verdict and its mapping onto the two error ids -- one place to write the line means a
    third delivery path gets the gate record for free instead of being the one that forgot.
    ★ The trajectory line carries the error ID only, never the judge's own words ★: the
    judge explains itself in the buyer's language, and that prose has no business on disk
    in a file the eval layer will read back.

    The trajectory ``result`` stays ``refused`` for ``needs_buyer_input``, which is accurate
    -- ★the delivery really was refused★ -- even though the loop's next move is a question
    rather than a stop. ``trajectory.RESULTS`` is EV1's vocabulary (``ok`` / ``refused`` /
    ``error`` / ``skipped``) and is not this module's to widen; the ``reason`` field already
    carries the error id, so the two cases are told apart in the record without inventing a
    fifth verb that the eval layer does not know how to read.
