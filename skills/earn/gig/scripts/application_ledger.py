"""application_ledger.py -- what happened to the application, from the ledgers alone.

Why this exists: the gig loop applied 110 times and could not say what came of any of
them. Measured 2026-07-27 on the real files:

  ~/gig/applied.jsonl   224 rows, and NOT an application ledger. It is the apply lane's
                        AND the nurture lane's AND the pass bookkeeper's shared scratch
                        pad. status = applied 110 / replied 71 / no_action_all_current 24
                        / absent 10 / one-offs. requestId holds "b1-nurture-sweep-pass129"
                        and "talkroom-90000000" next to real 募集 ids. Of the 110
                        applications, 2 ever got a follow-up row under the same requestId.
  ~/gig/earnings.jsonl  2 rows whose requestId is a TALKROOM id (90000010), while
                        applied.jsonl's requestId is a 募集 id (91000018). The join
                        matched zero rows, so category_bandit.py joined on exact title
                        instead -- a string coincidence standing in for identity.

So no reward could be attributed to any application, and every downstream learner (the
X8 bandit, the 50/50 self-improve EVAL, strategy.json keep/revert) was optimising against
an outcome it could not observe. That is upstream of any choice of learning algorithm.

The missing link was already on disk and unused. coconala_queue_snapshot.py walks
talkroom -> offer page and reads the 募集 id off it (OFFER_EXPRESSION,
`No.(\\d+)` / `/requests/(\\d+)`), emitting orders[] = {talkroom_id, request_id}. This
module turns that into a durable, append-only chain and uses it to answer one question
per application: how far did it get?

TAXONOMY (decided here, imported by everyone else, never re-derived)

  event      application  status "applied" -- we submitted a proposal to a 募集
             engagement   status says the deal moved (replied/delivered/...) -- this is
                          progress on an EXISTING application, never a new one. Counting
                          these as applications is what made 224 rows look like 224
                          applications.
             sweep        pass-level bookkeeping ("no_action_all_current"): the lane ran
                          and found nothing to do. It is about the pass, not about any
                          one application.
             unknown      no status. 10 live rows. Silence is not evidence of anything.

  identity   A 募集 id is bare decimal digits. Scoped tokens ("talkroom-90000000",
             "dm-9954245") name a different object and are read as such. Everything else
             ("N/A", "b1-nurture-sweep-pass129") names nothing.
             A bare-digit id is AMBIGUOUS: the historical paid-progress writer falls back
             to the talkroom id in the requestId field. Only the chain disambiguates it.
             Digit length is NOT used -- that is a guess dressed up as a rule.

  chain      (募集 id, talkroom id) pairs, append-only in ~/gig/identity_chain.jsonl,
             each carrying the evidence file it was read from. EXACT MATCH ONLY. A
             talkroom that maps to two 募集 ids resolves to NOTHING and is reported in
             `conflicts`; a wrong attribution teaches a wrong lesson, which is strictly
             worse than an absent one.

  stage      applied < engaged < contracted < paid. A stage is a property of the
             APPLICATION -- the deepest point it ever reached -- not of whichever row was
             read last. Evidence for each:
               engaged     an engagement event under the same 募集 id
               contracted  an engagement event saying so, OR the chain links this 募集 to
                           a talkroom seen in the queue snapshot's ORDERS lane (a deal
                           exists, whatever the agent did or did not write down)
               paid        an earnings row whose identity resolves, THROUGH THE CHAIN, to
                           this 募集 id. Titles are never used.

  honesty    What cannot be attributed is counted, not invented:
               unlinked              applications with no talkroom link yet
               unrecoverable         application/engagement events whose id names nothing
               orphan_engagements    progress on a 募集 we have no application row for --
                                     the pre-history from before this ledger existed
               unattributed_earnings money we received that no application explains

Contract: read-only and never fatal, exactly like listing_ledger.py. Only record_links()
writes, and only ever appends. Nothing here performs or triggers customer-facing work.
