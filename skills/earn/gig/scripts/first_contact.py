"""Decide, before building anything, whether this paid order says what to build.

★ The exit that matters is not "stop". ★ 2026-08-07 23:36, order 91000001: the buyer had
written 「題材『パズルクエストX』… 納品はGoogleドキュメントでお願いします」 and nothing else,
the posting they bought from said 「ポケモン動画の企画・台本作成」, and the builder ran blind for
two and a half minutes and produced a general guide to the game. It passed acceptance, it
passed the artifact judge, and the pass came one step from formally delivering it. The
platform cancels an order the seller has not spoken in within 48 hours, so the same
silence that produced the wrong artifact was also about to lose the fee outright.

Three exits, and only one of them is failure:

| exit    | when                                                                        |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| build   | the order is understood -- the loop proceeds exactly as before               |
| ask     | the order is underspecified -- ask the buyer a real question about the job,  |
|         | which is progress AND satisfies the 48-hour first-contact clock              |
| await   | we already asked and they have not answered -- do not build a guess          |

★ The judgement is only ever made about a room we have never spoken in. ★ Once a
conversation exists the answer stops being reliable enough to act on -- measured, see
``decide`` branch 4 -- and the paths built for that case (the builder's own BLOCKED record,
and the artifact judge) are already better than a guess.

★ Why this exists as a separate cheap step. ★ Before it, the only path from "a paid order
with no artifact" to "a message reaching the buyer" ran through the builder writing
``evidence/acceptance-blocked.json`` (gig_pass.sh ``ask_buyer_when_blocked``, called from
inside ``run_paid_work`` after the builder returns). Contact was therefore a side effect of
spending a full model-budget build, never its purpose -- and a builder confident enough to
produce the wrong thing never writes that record at all. This asks one bounded question of
one toolless session and, when the answer is "nobody has said what to make", writes the
same BLOCKED record the builder would have written. ★ Nothing downstream changes. ★ The
existing ask lane (``ask_buyer.py`` / ``ask_buyer_pass.py``), its persona, its ledger, its
telegram report and its send path all read that record exactly as before.

★ What it reads. ★ ``context/current.json``, compiled every pass by
``project_context_compiler.py`` from posting, DM, talkroom and requirements (B1 / 26701105
collects them). No second collector. The one thing the compiled context does NOT carry is
★what was ordered★ -- measured on the live 23:30 pass, ``grep -c 企画 PAID_WORK.prompt.txt``
returned 0, so the builder never saw the words 「企画・台本作成」 at all. That title lives on
the queue item, so the queue item is the second input here and the title is what the
decision turns on.

★ Fails to ``build``. ★ Unreachable provider, malformed answer, unknown decision string:
all become ``build``, which is what the loop did before this file existed. The opposite
direction would let one broken model call freeze a paid order, and -- worse -- a gate that
guessed "ask" would put a question in front of a paying customer on the strength of a
result it could not read.

# it reports that as its own error id rather than as a refusal. That is the same situation

#
# Expected, all optional:

#   artifact_judge.ASK_THE_BUYER_ERRORS    : container of str
#   artifact_judge.should_ask_the_buyer(x) : callable  x is an error id or "<id>:<reason>"
#
# Observed at TWO surfaces, because the verdict reaches disk by two routes and the second
# one was found by measurement, not by reading the code:
#
#   a) ``~/gig/evidence/gig-pass-*/paid-work-transaction.json`` -- newest FINISHED ledger
#      for this project_root; key ``failure_reason`` (written by ``rollback_transaction``)
#      plus any string in ``validation.errors``. This is the route when the builder ran and
#      its package was refused, and it is the same reader shape
#      ``paid_work_prior_rejection_clause`` in gig_pass.sh already uses.
#
#   b) ``~/gig/evidence/gig-pass-*/trajectory.jsonl`` -- rows with ``action == "judge"``,
#      ``ok == false`` and ``reason`` set, keyed by ``resource_key`` of
#      ``project:<request_id>`` or ``talkroom:<talkroom_id>``.
#      ★ Measured live 2026-08-08 00:05 JST. ★ Order 91000001 arrived with
#      delivery_action=formal, so gig_pass.sh skipped run_paid_work entirely, no
#      transaction ledger was opened at all, and the judge fired from inside the delivery
#      browser instead: the only record of
#      ``reason":"order_underspecified_ask_the_buyer"`` anywhere in that pass was one
#      trajectory line. A reader that only knew route (a) would have seen nothing and paid
#      for a second opinion about a question already answered.
#
# ★ Degrades to absent. ★ If the module will not import, or none of the three names exist,
# this shortcut is simply not taken and the model call below decides instead. Nothing here
# may raise: their file is not committed yet and may be mid-edit on disk.

# sat at ``delivery_action=formal, formal_delivery_checkbox=true, priority -1``, A8's judge
# refused the armed artifact with ``order_underspecified_ask_the_buyer``, and the order
# could not reach the lane that would have asked. The refusal stopped a bad delivery and
# stopped nothing else: ~/gig/ask-buyer.jsonl stayed at two rows, the buyer heard nothing,
# and Coconala cancels the order on 8/9 23:00.
#
# ★ Only recorded facts open this path -- never a judgement. ★ On the pre-build side
# (``decide``) a model may be asked whether an order is understood. Here it may not: an
# order at ``formal`` has an artifact that passed every gate, and diverting a good delivery
# on a guess stops the loop earning, which is worse than the bug. The single trigger is a
# judge verdict, for this order, that the buyer has not since replied to.
#
# ★ The artifact is left armed. ★ Nothing is deleted and nothing is unarmed. Rebuilding
# produced the same wrong thing on 2026-08-07 and would again; what changes is where this
# pass routes, not what is on disk. When the buyer answers, ``delivery_cadence`` raises
# ``buyer_feedback_unprocessed`` on its own, ``artifact_missing`` becomes true and the order
# reaches ``work_required`` -- the builder resumes with the answer, through machinery that
# already exists.
