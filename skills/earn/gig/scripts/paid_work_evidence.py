    # Everything above is structure: hashes bind, versions increase, paths stay inside the
    # project, two records agree. A 2173-byte 「ご依頼内容の確認資料」 satisfies all of it,
    # and on 2026-08-07 three of them did, one after another, each one PASSing its own
    # acceptance. The generic bootstrap validator these projects carry checks that the file
    # exists, exceeds 1024 bytes and has an allowed extension -- so nothing anywhere in the
    # pass looked at what the file was.
    #
    # Asked last, and only of an otherwise clean package, for two reasons. It costs a
    # model call, and an artifact already failing a structural check is not going to be
    # delivered whatever the answer -- so a broken manifest never bills. It also keeps the
    # count at the one call per order per pass that 31-gig-todo10 §2.4 budgeted, since
    # validate_and_promote runs this function three times over the same bytes.
    #
    # ★ Fails CLOSED, and the direction is worth stating because four call sites in this
    # codebase read a verdict like this and two of them fail the other way: here the
    # question is "may I ship?", so anything short of a definite yes refuses. ★ Judge
    # unreachable, judge timed out, malformed result, unknown verdict string and "no judge
    # was supplied" all land on artifact_judgement_undeterminable and all stop the
    # delivery. A gate that ships when it cannot see is the 2026-08-06 incident.
