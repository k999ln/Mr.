"""Sync project state.json from the authoritative talkroom observation.

Why: state.json drifts from the real screen whenever something happens outside the
step that owns it -- a human sends the delivery by hand, a pass dies mid-step, or a
later observation supersedes an earlier decision. Measured on 2026-07-27 for the live
40,000 JPY order: state.json said formal_delivery=False and was 9.5 hours old, while
the newest talkroom snapshot said formal_delivery_confirmed=true and
transaction_state=納品確認待ち. A loop that plans from a stale state re-does delivered
work or asks the buyer for what it already has -- the exact behaviour that cost trust
on this account.

Direction of trust: the live talkroom DOM wins over our own notes. Fields only move
toward what was actually observed.

Safety rules, deliberate:
  * evidence-backed truths are never downgraded -- once a delivery has been seen as
    confirmed, a later snapshot that lacks the field does not flip it back to False.
    Only an explicit False observation can lower it.
  * writes are atomic (tmp + os.replace, per the checkpoint pattern in
    anthropics/defending-code-reference-harness) so a kill mid-write cannot leave a
    truncated state.json that breaks the next pass.
  * every change is appended to events.jsonl with before/after and the evidence file,
    so a human can audit what moved and why.
  * unknown/extra keys in state.json are preserved untouched.

Usage:
  state_reconciler.py --project 90000000
  state_reconciler.py --all [--dry-run]
