"""promote_gate_run.py — close-loop Gap 3: the EFFECTFUL driver `promote_gate.sh` invokes.

Confined here (mirrors `lib/promote.py`'s own "subprocess deliberately confined to THIS module"
convention): everything that talks to a real subprocess (the fresh `claude --model opus` adversary
call) or performs the actual promotion side effect. The DETERMINISTIC/pure decision logic
(`assess_candidate`/`decide_promotion`/`promote_if_approved`) lives in `lib/promote_gate.py` and is
unit-tested there (`tests/test_adversary_disapprove.py`) WITHOUT ever spending a real LLM call —
this module is instead exercised by the one real, human-zero "RUN IT ONCE" proof invocation
(evidence under `evidence/close-loop/`), never by the fast pytest suite.

REQ-RH4 order enforced end-to-end: (1)+(2) (stage2 beats_baseline + trip-wire clear) are checked by
`assess_candidate` BEFORE this module ever shells out to an LLM — an ineligible candidate never
costs a single token. Only an eligible candidate reaches step (3), the fresh adversary call.

Usage: `python3 lib/promote_gate_run.py <candidate_program_path> <run_dir> [--dry-run]`
`--dry-run` (or `PROMOTE_GATE_DRY_RUN=1`) still runs the full assessment + real adversary call, but
never actually commits the promotion (useful for smoke-testing the mechanism against a
hand-crafted candidate without mutating the committed baseline strategy file).

self-improve harness (behavioral-spec.md REQ-RH4 step 3). This is a PAPER/BACKTEST-ONLY harness —
nothing you approve executes a live trade; "promote" only means merging this diff into a committed
backtest strategy file (strategies/pm_backtest_strategy.py). No human is in this loop; your verdict
is the final gate before any promotion.

DETERMINISTIC PRE-CHECKS (already computed, before you were invoked — you do not need to
re-derive these, but you MAY spot-check anything below using Read/Bash if you want independent
verification):
- scope_guard verdict: {assessment['scope_guard_reason']} (ok={assessment['scope_guard_ok']})
- stage1_pass: {assessment['stage1_pass']}
- stage2_pass (beats_baseline): {assessment['stage2_pass']}
- combined_score (risk-adjusted, candidate): {assessment['combined_score']}
- baseline_stage2_score (risk-adjusted, baseline): {assessment['baseline_stage2_score']}

- worst_window_oos_net_usd: {assessment['worst_window_oos_net_usd']}
- trip-wire clear (not an implausible >3x jump over population_best={assessment['population_best_used']}): {assessment['tripwire_clear']}

THE DIFF (candidate vs the frozen baseline, EVOLVE-BLOCK region only — scope_guard already
verified nothing outside it changed):
```diff
{diff_text}
```

YOUR JOB: decide whether this candidate represents a GENUINE selection/edge improvement, or is
variance-amplification / leverage / overfitting to this specific historical fixture dressed up as
one. Specifically weigh:
1. Does the candidate change WHICH trades are selected (a real selection/logic change), or does it
   only change stake SIZE on the same selection as baseline (leverage)? A pure stake multiplier on
   an unchanged selection cannot genuinely raise a risk-adjusted (mean/stddev) score except by
   floating-point noise — if you see one anyway, treat it with suspicion.
2. Is the worst individual OOS window (`worst_window_oos_net_usd` above) non-negative, or does the
   apparent improvement hide behind a good average with a hidden bad window (EDGE-5)?
3. Is std_oos_net_usd suspiciously close to zero (a near-zero-variance artifact from only 3 OOS
   data points can produce an inflated ratio that is not really "proven" by 3 points)?
4. Does the candidate's own code stay inside the single evolvable function
   (`score_candidate`), doing plausible strategy logic (thresholds, sizing, feature combination) —
   not something structurally suspicious?

Write your verdict as your ONLY structured output: {{"verdict": "PASS" or "FAIL", "reason": "<one
paragraph, concrete, citing the specific numbers/diff content that drove your decision>"}}.
"PASS" means you are willing to have this candidate promoted into the committed baseline strategy
file for future backtest runs. Default to FAIL when genuinely uncertain (fail-closed)."""
