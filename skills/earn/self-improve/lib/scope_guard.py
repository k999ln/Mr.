"""scope_guard.py — the SOLE structural enforcement of REQ-DL1's denylist and the EVOLVE-BLOCK
scope boundary (INV-3).

openevolve itself provides NO enforcement of this boundary — verified directly against the real
algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve source (behavioral-spec.md "Scope of the strategy
program"): `controller.py::_load_initial_program()` reads the WHOLE file; `prompt/templates.py`
shows the LLM the ENTIRE `current_program` with no marker-respecting instruction; the diff path's
`apply_diff()` matches against the whole `parent.code`; full-rewrite mode sets
`child_code = new_code` (the entire file, zero scoping); `parse_evolve_blocks()` exists but is
dead code, never called from the real generation/evaluation path. `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START/END`
markers are therefore an LLM-facing PROMPT CONVENTION ONLY, never a technical boundary.

100% of the actual enforcement is THIS module, operating on the ACTUAL resulting candidate file
text (`child_code`), compared against the frozen baseline file — never a defensive second check on
top of any openevolve-native guarantee, because none exists.

Public entrypoint: check(candidate_code, baseline_code) -> (ok: bool, reason: str).
