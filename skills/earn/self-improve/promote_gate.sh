# promote_gate.sh — close-loop Gap 3: REQ-RH4 step 3, the per-candidate promotion adversary.
#
# Thin shell entrypoint (mirrors run_evolve.sh's own absolute-path/minimal-PATH conventions — no
# reliance on `command -v` for the durable venv) around lib/promote_gate_run.py, which does the
# real work: deterministic pre-checks (scope_guard/stage1/stage2/trip-wire, via
# lib/promote_gate.py — unit-tested, no LLM cost), and — ONLY for a candidate that clears all of
# those — a real, fresh, headless `claude --model opus` adversary call (exactly the
# $LIFE_MANAGER_REPO/skills/self/self-fix.sh pattern: --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions, here as a
# synchronous `--print` call rather than a detached tmux session, since promote_gate.sh needs the
# verdict back before deciding whether to promote — no human anywhere in this path).
#
# Usage: promote_gate.sh <candidate_program_path> <run_dir> [--dry-run]
#   <candidate_program_path>  the openevolve-proposed strategy file to assess (e.g.
#                             $RUN_DIR/best/best_program.py)
#   <run_dir>                 where assessment.json / promote_gate.log / verdict.json are written
#   --dry-run                 (or PROMOTE_GATE_DRY_RUN=1) run the full real assessment + real
#                             adversary call, but never actually commit a promotion — for
#                             smoke-testing the mechanism against a hand-crafted candidate without
#                             mutating the committed baseline strategy file.
