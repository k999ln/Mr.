"""evaluator.py — the effectful evaluation shell openevolve calls per candidate.

`evaluate(program_path)` / `evaluate_stage1(program_path)` / `evaluate_stage2(program_path)` each
return a PLAIN DICT (openevolve's real `EvaluationResult` also accepts a plain dict of metrics —
see openevolve's evaluator interface; this module deliberately does NOT `import openevolve` so the
deterministic tests in tests/ stay dependency-light and runnable without vendoring the real
package, per this stage's scope).

`evaluate_stage1` runs `scope_guard.check(...)` FIRST, before any backtest computation (REQ-DL5).
When scope_guard rejects a candidate, evaluation stops immediately: the returned
`combined_score` is the fail-sentinel (REQ-EV6/DL5) and `evaluate_stage2` is NEVER called for
that candidate.

`combined_score` is ALWAYS derived from a real backtest over the historical fixture — never an LLM
judge's subjective score (REQ-GR1, REQ-EV1, Jason Wei's Verifier's Law). Stage1's `combined_score`
is raw `net_usd(gross, cost)` on the cheap filter window (unchanged). Stage2's (and therefore the
full `evaluate()` cascade's) `combined_score` is a RISK-ADJUSTED metric —
`gate_math.risk_adjusted_score(oos_scores)`, a Sharpe-like mean/stddev over the walk-forward OOS
window scores — added in the close-loop revision (2026-07-08) specifically because a raw-USD
stage2 score let a real accepted candidate (`233d923c`, see execution-notes-self-improve.md) win
purely by leveraging (scaling up) the SAME trade selection as baseline, not by finding a better
one. Risk-adjusting is structurally leverage-resistant (see `gate_math.risk_adjusted_score`'s own
docstring for the proof) while still being 100% backtest-derived, deterministic, and non-LLM —
still Verifier's Law-compliant, just risk- rather than magnitude-scored.

This module reads the historical fixture (read-only) and NEVER writes to `earn-ledger.jsonl` or
any other live-system state file (REQ-EV7). It NEVER imports any order-execution module
(`place_order`, `execute_swap`, a live `run.sh`) — REQ-RH3's sandbox boundary.
