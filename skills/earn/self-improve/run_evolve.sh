# run_evolve.sh — LOOP 2's recurring self-improve trigger (REQ-OE7). Full autonomous cycle
# (close-loop revision, 2026-07-08): OBSERVE (read the REAL realized-P&L ledger) -> EVOLVE (real
# openevolve, risk-adjusted fitness) -> promote_gate.sh (per-candidate fresh adversary, REQ-RH4) ->
# PROMOTE-or-log. Invokes openevolve (real CLI entrypoint `openevolve-run`, NO `.py` suffix — that
# name does not exist anywhere on this machine, confirmed by `ls <venv>/bin` after `pip install
# openevolve`) as the ONLY mechanism that proposes strategy edits (REQ-OE1) — no hand-written
# mutation/selection code path is added here as a substitute. No human prompt anywhere in this
# path; every input is a file already on disk (this script, config.yaml,
# strategies/pm_backtest_strategy.py, evaluator.py) or the real earn-ledger.jsonl (read-only).
#
# This phase (behavioral-spec.md) is paper/backtest ONLY: evaluator.py never invokes any live
# order-execution path, and this script never sets/relies on a nonzero spend cap (INV-6).
# promote_gate.sh's own promotion step only ever commits a backtest strategy FILE — never a live
# trade.
#
# Trigger wiring (REQ-OE7): launchd/ai.anicca.self-improve-evolve.plist invokes this script on a
# recurring StartInterval — never a human manually running it. launchd gives the process a
# minimal default PATH (no project/user customization), so this script does NOT rely on `command
# -v` finding openevolve (or python3, or claude) on PATH at all — it invokes fixed, durable,
# non-scratchpad paths by ABSOLUTE path (`~/.anicca-venvs/self-improve/bin/openevolve-run` /
# `.../bin/python3`, expanded via $HOME so they resolve under whatever HOME launchd sets; `claude`
# resolves via the plist's own explicit PATH, which includes /opt/homebrew/bin). That venv is
# intentionally OUTSIDE this git repo (never committed) and outside any session scratchpad (which
# gets cleaned between sessions).
