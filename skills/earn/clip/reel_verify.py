"""Shared pure verification logic for the clip-earn IG-reel posting/self-heal pipeline.

Used by both poster.py (earn/marketing-engine, the free instagrapi-based
poster; SHARED-1 retired the earlier web-composer poster) and this directory's self-heal
driver (self_heal.py). One implementation, no duplicate/drifting logic across the two call sites.

Per .vcsdd/features/clip-post-verify-hardening/specs/verification-architecture.md
(REQ-001..REQ-010, PROP-001..PROP-011): every function here is PURE (no I/O, no
sleep, no network) except stabilize_reads, which is an impure DRIVER that calls
an injected read_fn and delegates every comparison to the pure _reads_stable.
