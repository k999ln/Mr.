export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$PATH"  # launchd has a minimal PATH; tmux/python3/node/claude live in homebrew
# clip-healthcheck.sh — OS-level supervisor (launchd, every 5min). If the always-on clip-core
# tmux session is dead, restart it. Copied from Sutando's health-check-fallback role.
#
# v2 (2026-07-04, タスク#7): tmux socket loss (root cause still under investigation) made
# `has-session` return false-DEAD while the underlying claude process was still alive,
# so a new session got started ON TOP of it. Across 4 loops this piled up to 8 processes
# per loop over ~12h and pushed Load Avg to 8.99 (real incident, confirmed via `ps aux`).
# Fix, ported from gig-healthcheck.sh's proven pattern:
#   (a) pkill by PROCESS NAME before restart — survives even when the socket itself is gone
#   (b) backoff cap (max 5 restarts/60min) — stops a runaway restart loop from burning the
#       Claude subscription if the underlying cause recurs faster than we can fix it
#
# NOTE (2026-07-04, same session): an "also reap orphans on every ALIVE check" v3 attempt
# was tried and REVERTED — both a pane_pid-based and a newest-by-start-time heuristic each
# ended up killing the one genuinely live process (verified: session went from ALIVE to
# "no server running" right after a reap). Auto-detecting "which of N same-named processes
# is the real one" from outside is unreliable; do not re-add without a verified-safe method.
# Existing orphans from past incidents must be cleaned up MANUALLY (`ps aux | grep`, compare
# start times, kill all but the one attached to `tmux ... list-sessions`) — see Task #7.
#
# v4 (2026-07-04, self-heal-harness spec, Sutando+Cronicle patterns): add a self-exclusion
# lock so overlapping healthcheck runs (launchd firing before the prior run finished) can
# never race each other's DEAD→pkill-then-restart sequence — this race is a strong
# candidate for HOW the v2 pkill-by-name still let duplicates through. macOS has no
# `flock` binary (confirmed absent, unlike Linux), so this uses mkdir as an atomic lock
# (same proven pattern as ~/scripts/disk-cleaner.sh's LOCK_DIR).
#
# v5 (2026-07-04, self-heal-harness spec): STALE detection, ported verbatim from
# gig-healthcheck.sh (the one loop that never suffered a duplicate-pile-up). Detects
# "tmux session alive but the in-session hourly cron stopped firing" via a heartbeat
# file the cron prompt touches only on a genuinely COMPLETED pass (clip-cli.sh STARTUP
# now does `FINALLY touch .clip-core-last-pass`). STALE_MIN=90 matches clip's hourly
# cadence (gig uses the same 90min for its hourly cadence too).
