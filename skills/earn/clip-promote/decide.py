"""decide.py — PURE state-machine decision for the earn/clip-promote slot (promote.fun USDC-Solana
per-view clipping). No I/O, no browser: given the pipeline state + now (epoch seconds), return the ONE
transition this wake should run. Testable in isolation (tests/test_decide.py). Mirrors earn/video/decide.py.

The clip-promote lifecycle (one campaign-clip item at a time, then free the slot for the next):
  SELECT    no active item            → pick an ACTIVE, IG-eligible, not-already-clipped campaign
  JOIN      campaign selected         → actually join it on promote.fun. A campaign's minimum-follower
                                         requirement is INVISIBLE until join is attempted (its Rules tab
                                         is locked pre-join) — REQ-1b (2026-07-04, follower-gate reality
                                         discovered live: 15/17 IG-eligible campaigns were already Ended/
                                         budget-exhausted despite showing "Live"; the 2 genuinely open
                                         ones both required 200/2000 followers against our 0-follower
                                         fresh account). If join fails on a follower-count gate, record
                                         the campaign as PERMANENTLY skipped (never worth retrying until
                                         our follower count changes) and go back to SELECT for the next
                                         candidate — never fabricate progress past a gate we didn't clear.
  CLIP      campaign chosen + joined  → produce a 15-45s 1080x1920 clip (earn-clip-rewards)
  POST      clip ready                → post --live to a WARMED account, capture the post URL
  SUBMIT    posted                    → submit the post URL to the campaign on promote.fun
  MEASURE   submitted+accepted        → read views; loop here until the campaign ENDS or it STALLS
  WITHDRAW  campaign ended + balance>0 → claim USDC on Solana, capture the signature
  RECORD    sig captured             → verify the Solana sig + append the ONLY earned_usdc>0 line (DONE)
  STALLED   0 views past DEAD_ZERO_HOURS, or submission rejected/dead → free the slot, narrate

DONE = a RECORD wake only. Every other wake prints earned_usdc:0 and keeps the slot `declared`.
DEAD_ZERO_HOURS (default 48) is the honest dead-vs-early-zero discriminator: a shadowban can't be
detected directly (a throttled reel still resolves + stays accepted), so 0 views past the bound = dead.

★ DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE every affiliate/campaign-monetization AI should carry (Dais 2026-07-04 verbatim):
"in order to do good money-making affiliate work, you have to earn trust and followers first." A
0-follower brand-new account cannot usually join a paying campaign directly — most campaigns gate on a
minimum follower count. The fix is NOT to keep hunting for a zero-requirement campaign forever; it is to
run the account's REGULAR posting loop (earn/clip, same @handle) in parallel so it organically accrues
followers/trust, and let this SELECT/JOIN loop keep politely reporting no-eligible-campaign until the
account's real follower count clears a campaign's bar. Two loops, one shared account, patience by design.
