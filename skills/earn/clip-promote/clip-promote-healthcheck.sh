# clip-promote-healthcheck.sh — OS-level supervisor (launchd, every 5min). If the always-on
# clip-promote-core tmux session is dead, restart it. Ported verbatim (v5 pattern) from
# clip-healthcheck.sh / gig-healthcheck.sh — same incidents, same fixes, applied up front instead
# of learned the hard way a second time:
#   (a) pkill by PROCESS NAME before restart — survives even when the tmux socket itself is gone
#   (b) backoff cap (max 5 restarts/60min) — stops a runaway restart loop from burning the Claude
#       subscription if the underlying cause recurs faster than we can fix it
#   (c) mkdir-based self-exclusion lock (macOS has no `flock`) — overlapping healthcheck runs can
#       never race each other's DEAD → pkill-then-restart sequence
#   (d) STALE detection — the tmux session can be ALIVE while the in-session internal cron has
#       stopped firing; a heartbeat file (touched only on a genuinely COMPLETED pass, never on
#       mere startup) catches this.
#
# STALE_MIN=250: clip-promote-cli.sh's internal cron fires every 2h (120min, promote.fun campaigns
# move slower than clip-rewards so a tighter cadence buys nothing). STALE_MIN must exceed one full
# internal-cron cycle with margin or this would false-restart every cycle; 250min ≈ 2x120min + 10min
# slack (same "≈2x the driving interval" ratio clip/gig use at their own cadence).

# box — including this script's own tmux+claude respawn — starts failing, so a DEAD session can
# restart-loop indefinitely even though the loop's own code is fine. That shared fix
# (hc_reclaim_disk_if_low) was applied to capafy/reddit/rockstar_ibot-loop via hc_run() but never
# ported to this standalone script, even though clip-promote-core-healthcheck.log shows the exact
