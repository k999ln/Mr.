"""join_campaign.py — JOIN (REQ-1b): actually attempt to join the SELECTed campaign on
promote.fun. A campaign's minimum-follower requirement is INVISIBLE until join is
attempted (its Rules tab stays locked with "Join the Campaign to unlock full details"
pre-join — verified live 2026-07-04 on thomas-rhett-content/susannah-joffe). This module
does the live attempt and classifies the outcome so the caller (run.sh) knows whether to
proceed to CLIP or mark the campaign permanently skipped.

Discovered live 2026-07-04 (fresh evidence, not assumed): of 17 IG-eligible campaigns,
15 were already Ended/budget-exhausted (some showed "Live" in the UI while their budget
bar read "$0.00 left" — Ended/budget state must be read from page text, not the badge
alone). The 2 genuinely open ones (thomas-rhett-content, susannah-joffe) both gated on a
minimum follower count (2000, 200) our fresh 0-follower account could not clear. See spec
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-openclaw-claude-p-merge-design.md §18 for the full
investigation. The takeaway (Dais 2026-07-04 verbatim): "in order to do good money-making
affiliate work, you have to earn trust and followers first" — this module's job is only
to detect the gate honestly, never to fabricate a join that didn't happen.
