"""decide.py — PURE state-machine decision for the earn/video slot. No I/O, no browser: given the
account state + today's date, return the ONE transition the loop should run this wake. Testable in isolation
(tests/test_decide.py). The faceless-video lifecycle (warmup→affiliate-link@day7→post→record) is expressed
here so the ONE loop drives it with ZERO human per wake — EVERY recurring step, including the day-7 affiliate
link, is a transition, never a manual後工程. (S0_create = a ONE-TIME bootstrap performed by the ig-account-create
skill, itself proven 0-human; the slot then runs the recurring S1–S4 lifecycle on the existing account.)

Transitions:
  S0_create   no account yet                              → create account + profile (icon+bio, NO link)
  S1_warmup   warming, day<7, not yet warmed today        → one day's humanized warmup
  noop        warming but already warmed today            → nothing (bounded/idempotent)
  S2_affiliate day>=7 AND affiliate not set AND not pending→ set affiliate/ebook link (the deferred step, in-loop)
  S3_post     warmed (warmup done) AND not posted today    → generate + post one faceless short (link optional;
                                                             posting builds audience even while the link is pending)
  S4_record   already posted today (or steady state)      → record only real external USDC inflows

S2 is RE-EVALUABLE, not a trap: run.sh refreshes `affiliate_available` from env EVERY wake (true iff a link
URL is configured). So at day>=7: if a link IS available and not yet set → S2 installs it; if NO link yet →
S2 is skipped and the machine keeps POSTING (S3) daily; the moment a link is configured, S2 fires on the next
wake and installs it. Never stalls, never needs a human, and the monetization link is never permanently unreachable.

    # ★ FIND-501 fix: DAILY POST has PRIORITY over the affiliate install. Posting must NEVER be starved by a
    #   failing/looping S2 (e.g. IG normalizes the website value so website_set stays false). So: if today's post
    #   isn't done yet → S3 first; the affiliate link installs on a later wake (same day, after posting, or next
    #   day) and retries daily until it sticks. Re-evaluable, never a permanent block on either posting or the link.

    #   attempt, S4_record runs — so a link IG perpetually strips can NEVER starve earnings recording. Retries daily. ★
