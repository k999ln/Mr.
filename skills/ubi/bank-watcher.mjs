// bank-watcher.mjs — A3 daemon pass for ③ JP bank-direct. SAFE-BY-DEFAULT orchestration for IRREVERSIBLE
// bank transfers. Designed against the double-pay failure modes an adversarial review found (FIND-A/B):
//
//   read queued → ATOMIC claim (only ids WE flipped queued→processing) → plan over claimed → dispatch.
//   - FIND-A: claim() must be an atomic compare-and-swap returning ONLY the ids it actually claimed, so two
//     overlapping passes can never both submit the same recipient. We dispatch ONLY the claimed subset.
//   - FIND-B: after a submit ATTEMPT the outcome is UNKNOWN (a bulk transfer may have been accepted before a
//     timeout). So on adapter failure we DO NOT re-queue — recipients stay 'processing' for reconciliation,
//     never auto-resubmitted. release() returns to 'queued' ONLY on a pre-dispatch skip (nothing was sent).
//   - markPaid sets 'submitted' (accepted ≠ 振込完了, FIND-005); a separate completion poll promotes →'paid'.
//
// Invariant (資金決済法): own-funds 給付 only.
