# Liveness heartbeat (FIND-032, ported from rockstar_ibot-loop): touch it HERE, in the deterministic MEASURE
# core (runs first on every pass — startup + daily cron — via STEP1, completes in ~2s, cannot derail).
# Previously the reddit heartbeat was touched ONLY at the very end of the open-ended STARTUP/cron pass
# ("FINALLY touch"), AFTER STEP2 ACT — and Reddit ACT routinely stalls (fresh top-level posts auto-removed
# by the spam filter at low karma; mod-message Send button client-side-disabled; an occasional interactive
# prompt) so the pass burns its whole 1800s timeout and never returns to the touch. That starved the
# heartbeat → healthcheck STALE(1560m) → restart → pkill kills the in-progress claude → fresh claude
# re-enters the same stalling ACT → still no touch in the 5-min window → STALE again → restart storm →
# give-up → self-fix. The healthcheck contract is "liveness + stuck-detection only" (real posting truth =
# posts.jsonl freshness, checked separately by the output guard), so liveness must mean "the loop executed
# its measurable core this pass", NOT "the open-ended posting task completed". Skip under test mode so the
# real prod heartbeat is never touched by test-loop.sh.
