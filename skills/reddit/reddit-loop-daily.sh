# reddit-loop-daily.sh — DETERMINISTIC daily trigger for the Reddit demand-gen loop (self-fix
# 2026-07-12: found via live audit that the tmux STARTUP prompt's self-registered `CronCreate
# "0 10 * * *"` never actually persisted a recurring pass — the always-on tmux session
# (anicca-reddit-loop) ran ONE real pass at its Jul 10 09:55 startup (commit 0f6dca06, posted to
# r/IMadeThis) then sat idle for 2+ days with zero subsequent activity; posts.jsonl went stale for
# 30h+ and the healthcheck's output-freshness guard kept escalating to self-fix, which repeatedly
# spawned fixer sessions (many of which themselves hung) instead of fixing the actual scheduling
# gap. Root cause: an in-session model/tmux process is not a real
# OS/gateway scheduler — CronCreate jobs are session-scoped, in-memory, and gone once the session
# ends or (per the tool's own docs) simply never a durable trigger to begin with. This is the exact
# bug already found+fixed for capafy-loop (commit 41938abe) and rockstar_ibot/connector before it;
# same fix here: copy the proven connector_fill_gaps.sh / capafy-loop-daily.sh pattern — a launchd
# StartCalendarInterval job calls THIS script directly, once a day, bounded + timeout-guarded, no
# reliance on the LLM self-scheduling itself.

PROMPT="${PROMPT:-} Perform one full Reddit loop pass now: measure the canonical state, heal Camofox if needed, then make exactly one honest disclosed contribution when the account is active and the ledger is stale; verify the real Reddit URL in a fresh browser navigation and append only verified evidence to ~/profitable-claude/skills/reddit/state/posts.jsonl. The canonical Reddit runtime is ~/profitable-claude/skills/reddit; use that path for every measure and ledger write. This is a bounded pass: if browser navigation or posting has not produced a verified success within 120 seconds, stop the ACT attempt, record the precise blocker, touch the heartbeat, and return a failure result so the supervisor can retry later; never hang until the outer runner timeout. Commit tracked runtime ledger changes in the profitable-claude repo after confirming its remote; do not commit the legacy ~/anicca mirror."
