"""dework-discover.py — wallet-native crypto bounty discover for the bounty earn slot.

The GitHub-free well (Dais pivot 2026-07-01): Dework's GraphQL read endpoint needs NO auth and NO
GitHub. We fetch open (TODO) tasks, keep only those paying a real crypto token to a wallet, drop the
obvious MLM/recruitment noise with a COARSE pre-filter, and hand the survivors to the loop's brain —
the MODEL decides which task is genuinely doable + legit + worth doing (no hardcoded judgment; the
pre-filter only removes structural spam so the model isn't drowned). Identity to actually claim =
wallet-connect or Discord (no GitHub). Verified live 2026-07-01: 1045 TODO, 55 crypto-reward.

Usage: python3 dework-discover.py [out.json]   # writes {fetched_at, open_bounties:[...]}; prints count
Only real fetched tasks are emitted. No fakes (HARD 0.24).
