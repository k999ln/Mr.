// to earn, cold-outreach, or build trust. The user's connected info (gcal / Gmail / phone /
// location) is for managing the USER'S OWN life ONLY — never to earn.
//
// Polsia distinction: a founder using their OWN inbox for their OWN company = consented
// self-use (fine). Multi-tenant use of EACH user's identity to earn = the malice this forbids.
//
// This module is imported by the earn write-path (lib/record.mjs). Every earn-ledger line
// passes assertOwnIdentityOnly(); if the earn context references a user-PII source or env,
// it THROWS — the earn never records, the wake fails closed.

// Env-var name fragments that belong to a USER's connected identity (NOT Anicca's own).
// If any of these is present in the env handed to the earn path, the earn is tainted.
