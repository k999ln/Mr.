# Start camofox-browser server on :9377 if not running.
#
# self-fix 2026-07-12: a bare HTTP-200-on-/health check is not enough. The server's Node wrapper
# can stay alive (200 OK) for hours after its underlying browser has died (browserConnected:false,
# e.g. after the Camoufox binaries went missing from ~/Library/Caches/camoufox/, or a health-probe
# restart got stuck) -- "already running" was true but nothing could actually open a tab, and
# nobody noticed because this script never looked past the HTTP status code. Now we parse the
# health body and force a real restart (via stop.sh, fixed the same pass -- see its header)
# whenever the wrapper is up but the browser inside it is not.
