"""Resumable, machine-readable Codex sessions for the repair investigation.

SSOT §9.3.1 item H3 merged with §9.4 items C1 and C3.  This module owns three
things and nothing else, so the daily writing, editorial judge, and vision
paths are untouched:

* **C1 — the outcome is read, not guessed.**  `codex exec` exits only `0` or
  `1` (`codex-rs/exec/src/lib.rs`), so the exit status cannot name a failure
  class.  The verdict is derived from the `--json` JSONL event stream instead,
  and a failing slice records which event decided it.
* **H3 — a budget checkpoints instead of truncating.**  The live 2026-08-07
  receipt recorded `model.status TIMEOUT` at exactly its 120-second bound and
  therefore produced no verdict at all.  A slice that runs out of budget now
  persists the partial findings and the Codex session identity, and the next
  tick continues that same session.
* **C3 — resume is guarded and bounded.**  One investigation may be continued;
  a second may never be started beside it.  Slices per incident are bounded and
  exhaustion degrades to the safest known state instead of retrying forever.

Everything asserted about the wire format was measured against the installed
`codex-cli 0.145.0` on 2026-08-07, not read from documentation:

| Observation | Consequence here |
|---|---|
| success emits `turn.completed` with a `usage` block | `COMPLETED`; tokens are measured rather than declared unknown |
| failure emits top-level `{"type":"error"}` then `{"type":"turn.failed"}` and exits 1 | `FAILED`, naming the deciding event |
| an `item.completed` whose item `type` is `error` appeared inside a run that exited 0 with a completed turn | item-level errors are ADVISORY and must never be read as failure |
| a run killed mid-turn still flushed `thread.started` to its stdout file | the session id survives a budget kill, which is what makes a checkpoint possible |
| `codex exec resume <id>` recovered such a killed session in 5.0s with `cached_input_tokens` carried forward | an unterminated turn on disk is not itself a reason to refuse a resume |

Because that last measurement holds, the liveness guard for this path targets
the hazard that actually applies: a process still holding the session.  Running
a second turn on one thread is duplicate spend and is the inconsistent
"active thread with no running turn" state that openai/codex#37047 reports as
hanging `thread/resume` indefinitely.
