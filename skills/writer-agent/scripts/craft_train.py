"""Nightly SkillOpt trainer for skills/writing-craft/CRAFT.md (spec 47
19-4c T6, BUILD 3). This module holds every PURE decision --  counting
scored runs, comparing sha256, deciding accept/reject from a training
summary, and enforcing that the protected SLOW_UPDATE block never
changes -- so the contract test can drive all of it with fixtures and
fakes, no live model call, no live network. `craft-train.sh` is the thin
shell wrapper: it owns exporting the two OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_* environment
variables (never echoing the key) and then calls this module's CLI.

Why a defense-in-depth protected-block check lives HERE too, not just in
SkillOpt's own skillopt/optimizer/skill.py::_is_in_protected_region: this
script is the last thing that writes to the real CRAFT.md on disk. If a
future SkillOpt version's protection regresses, or a hand-edited
best_skill.md ever gets fed in, the copy-back step must still refuse
rather than trust the upstream guarantee blindly.

T15 wall-clock follow-up: this module also owns the pre-flight projection
(project_and_check_deadline, part 4) and the hard subprocess deadline
(run_training's timeout_s, part 3) -- both pure/fixture-testable given an
explicit now/deadline pair, still no live model call and no live network.
The one non-stdlib import is `yaml` (to read the real config's
limit/sel_env_num/test_env_num for the projection), which is NOT part of
the `skillopt` package and is available to the plain system python this
script actually runs under -- importing `skillopt` itself (e.g. via
`writing.rollout`) would still break that, and is deliberately avoided.
