"""Scan the writing rulebook for contradictions between its own rule
sources, mechanically, with no model calls -- the piece that keeps the
rulebook from rotting between training runs.

Why this exists: spec 47 section 19-4b / section 20. "The scanner never
edits anything and never says which side should die -- beat rate decides
that." This script's whole output is a list of TICKETS for a human or the
trainer to look at; it is not a fixer and it is not a judge. Every finding
is `{"class": "direct"|"drift"|"dead", "side1": "file:line",
"side2": "file:line"|None, "subject": "...", "quote1": "<=15 words",
"quote2": "<=15 words"|None}`.

Three detections, all mechanical (string/regex over the rule sources, no
LLM):

  1. DIRECT CONFLICT -- a statement that BANS something and a statement
     that RECOMMENDS something share AT LEAST TWO "distinctive" subject
     terms (a term appearing in AT MOST 3 statements across the whole
     corpus -- an absolute ceiling, not a relative one; see ROUND-3
     RECALIBRATION below). Capped at the top 20 pairs by shared-term
     count, with a suppressed-count reported alongside.
  2. DRIFTED PARAPHRASE -- two statements in DIFFERENT files share a
     majority of their distinctive terms, but one carries an absolute
     qualifier (must/always/never/only/唯一/必ず/non-negotiable) the other
     lacks: the same rule, restated with a stricter edge than the
     original measured claim.
  3. DEAD REFERENCE -- a referenced script/artifact path that does not
     resolve under ANY of several candidate roots (see ROUND-3
     RECALIBRATION), or a `gates/<name>.json` pattern that no script in
     scripts/ ever writes (checked by grepping scripts/ for the name, per
     the coordinator's spec -- this is intentionally the simple decision
     procedure asked for, not a static-analysis writer-tracker).

ROUND-3 RECALIBRATION (real scan against the actual rulebook: 1205 direct /
2 drift / 19 dead -> 20 direct + 23 suppressed / 1 drift / 17 dead):
  1. 1205 direct findings is the same as zero findings -- nobody reads
     1205 tickets. Root cause: the original spec's relative threshold
     ("appears in fewer than 20% of statements") is far too loose on a
     179-statement corpus -- a word appearing 30 times still clears 20%,
     so every ban paired with every recommend sharing ONE such word,
     quadratically. Three-part fix, all implemented: (a) the bar is now
     ABSOLUTE -- a term is distinctive only if it appears in at most 3
     statements total, not a fraction of the corpus; (b) a pair is
     reported only when it shares AT LEAST 2 distinctive terms, not 1 --
     one rare word in common is coincidence, two is a subject; (c) output
     is capped at the top 20 pairs by shared-term count descending, with
     `direct_suppressed` reporting how many more exist. The same absolute-
     rarity fix (a) applies to detection 2 automatically, since both share
     compute_distinctive_terms -- this is what turned drift's subjects
     from generic vocabulary ("image", "code") into a genuinely rare term.
  2. The dead detector resolved every relative reference against ONE root
     (the skill directory), producing a false positive: note-publish/
     publish-paid.py is real, but lives under scripts/note-publish/, not
     directly under the skill root. Fixed: a relative reference is now
     tried against four candidate roots -- the skill root, skill root +
     scripts/, the directory of the file that mentioned it, and the
     repository root -- and is only "dead" when it resolves under NONE of
     them (see _candidate_paths).

ROUND-4 FIX (gates evidence was incomplete: 19 dead -> 7 after adding run-
directory evidence): "no script writes it" was the ONLY evidence detect_
dead_gates used, and it was incomplete -- the daily prompt orders the MODEL
to write several of these gates directly (STEP 0.6: "copy each gate JSON
verdict there as gates/<gate-name>-<lang>.json"), so absence from scripts/
proves nothing about whether the gate is actually produced. Checked against
the real run directories: reader-questions-{ja,en}.json and platform-
dispatch(-results).jsonl are present in the most recent runs (something
produces them) despite no script constructing those paths -- both were
false positives. rubric-judge-{en,ja}.json is ALSO present as of the
latest run, reversing the round-3 conclusion that it was dead; that
conclusion rested on script evidence alone. self-improve-application.json
is genuinely absent from every recent run -- the one true positive that
was buried among the false ones. Fix: a gate reference is dead only when
no script writes it AND it is absent from all of the RECENT_RUNS_TO_CHECK
(3) most-recently-modified run directories under state/runs (see
_gate_present_in_recent_runs). A second, necessary fix: detect_dead_paths
(the general path detector) was independently re-extracting the same
gates/<name> tokens as ordinary path references and declaring them dead
via its own root-resolution logic, which has no concept of "produced by a
recent run" -- silently re-introducing the same false positives through a
different detector even after detect_dead_gates was fixed. extract_path_
references now excludes any token that is a gates/ artifact reference;
gates/ evidence belongs to detect_dead_gates exclusively.

Rule sources (paths relative to skills/writer-agent, all overridable via
--sources): reference/title-best-practices.md, SKILL.md, article-daily.sh
(only its lines longer than LONG_LINE_THRESHOLD chars -- article-daily.sh
is mostly shell plumbing; the actual prompt text lives in a handful of very
long lines. Generalised to ANY .sh file passed via --sources, not
hardcoded to this one filename, so a future second prompt script is
covered without a code change).

Design choices made because the spec left them open (simplest option,
noted here rather than asked about):
  * Term extraction: contiguous hiragana/katakana/kanji runs (len>=2) and
    English word tokens (len>=3, casefolded), minus a small standard
    English function-word stopword list (_EN_STOPWORDS). The spec's own
    reasoning is that the <20%-of-statements threshold alone suppresses
    "the"/common words; a first implementation trusted that literally and
    ran with zero stopword list. Running it against the actual bilingual
    rulebook and reading the output surfaced two real, sequential bugs
    (see compute_distinctive_terms's docstring for the first): even after
    fixing the population to be same-DOMINANT-language statements, "from"
    still measured at 18% (under the 20% floor) because ordinary English
    connectives are genuinely reused across many unrelated rule
    statements at this corpus size -- the literal reading of the spec's
    own stated mechanism does not, empirically, fully suppress function
    words on its own. A minimal standard stopword list (articles,
    prepositions, common pronouns/auxiliaries -- not a hand-tuned list
    reverse-engineered from this corpus) closes that gap and is the
    smallest fix that made the "the"/"from" example the spec itself gives
    actually hold.
  * Short, common English ban/recommend/qualifier words (never, always,
    only, must, works) are matched as WHOLE TOKENS via the same word-split
    approach goodhart.py uses -- bare substring matching would false-hit
    inside ordinary words ("network"/"framework" both contain "works").
    Longer, more distinctive markers (banned, rewarded, proven, non-
    negotiable, "do not", "must not", "use this") are matched as plain
    casefolded substrings, same trade-off goodhart.py already documents.
  * Detection 2's "share a majority of their distinctive terms" is
    implemented as an overlap coefficient: |shared| / min(|A|, |B|) > 0.5
    -- majority relative to the SMALLER statement's term set, which is
    what "majority" means when comparing two sets of different size.
  * Referenced-path resolution: a token starting with ~ is expanded to the
    real home directory and a token starting with / is absolute as given
    -- both tried directly, one root, since they are already unambiguous.
    Everything else (must contain at least one "/", i.e. look like an
    actual path rather than a bare filename mentioned in passing prose --
    "meta.json" used as a generic example is not a reference to a specific
    file) is tried against FOUR candidate roots (round-3 fix, see
    _candidate_paths): the skill directory, skill directory + scripts/,
    the directory of the file that mentioned it, and the repository root
    -- dead only if none of the four resolve. A path immediately wrapped
    in <...> (the CLI-argument-placeholder convention used throughout
    these prompts, e.g. "<original.md>") is excluded -- it is documenting
    a parameter shape, not naming a real file. One known remaining false-
    positive class, accepted rather than chased further: a bare relative
    reference whose intended root is a DIFFERENT project entirely (e.g.
    article-daily.sh's docs/loop-engineering/47-....md, which resolves
    under ~/anicca-project/, not any of the four roots tried) still shows
    up dead -- none of the four roots the coordinator specified cover an
    arbitrary sibling project, and guessing at other projects' locations
    would be scope creep beyond the specified fix.
  * quote1/quote2 are capped at 15 whitespace-delimited tokens when the
    text actually has word-spacing (English), or 90 characters when it
    does not (dense Japanese prose has no inter-word spaces to split on,
    so a literal "15 words" cap would return the entire clause).
  * A finding's `subject` for "direct" lists EVERY shared distinctive term
    (comma-joined, alphabetical), not just one -- showing more than one is
    the point of the round-3(b) >=2-shared-terms requirement, so hiding
    all but the first would defeat the purpose of raising the bar.
    "drift" still uses a single term (the alphabetically-first), since
    the coordinator's round-3 fix for detection 2 was the rare-term
    ceiling only, not a multi-term subject or a >=2 floor.
  * Findings are deduplicated: dead-reference findings by (class, subject)
    globally (the same missing script mentioned on 20 lines is one ticket,
    not 20); direct/drift findings are naturally unique per (side1, side2)
    pair since each statement pair is only compared once.

Known true positive (per the coordinator's spec): SKILL.md's former
blanket self-reference ban versus reference/title-best-practices.md's
First-person confessional pattern. As of this writing SKILL.md line 171-173
documents that this exact collapse was ALREADY split into two separate,
non-conflicting rules (identity vs craft) on a prior pass, so detection 1
does not currently surface that specific pair from the live files -- the
detector is proven against a synthetic fixture of that shape instead in
tests/rule-conflicts-contract.sh (a ban statement and a recommend
statement sharing two rare terms, "self"/"reference" plus "author"/
"naming"/"voice"), and this is stated here rather than silently working
around it. The round-3 recalibration (a stricter absolute rarity bar plus
a >=2-shared-terms floor) is specifically checked NOT to have silenced
this fixture -- a detector that reports nothing is exactly as broken as
one reporting 1205, and this is the test that tells the two apart.

    fewer than 20% of all statements"). On the real 179-statement
    bilingual corpus that bar was far too loose -- a term appearing 30
    times still clears 20%, so ordinary vocabulary ("fail", "runs",

    paired with every recommend that happened to share one, producing

    term is only distinctive if it appears in at most 3 statements, full
    stop, regardless of corpus size. Rare terms are what made the real
    historical case detectable (一人称/self-reference genuinely occur a
    handful of times; "fail" does not), so the bar is tightened to only
    keep terms that are actually rare, not merely under-represented
    relative to a large denominator. A prior version of this function

    statements plus a stopword list to fight a bilingual false-positive
    (ordinary English words looking rare only because most of the corpus
    is Japanese) -- with an absolute, small, language-agnostic ceiling
    like 3, that machinery is no longer needed: a genuinely common word in

    output; a lookbehind-based regex fix was tried first and still let the
    regex engine start a bogus match mid-token. A word containing the
    recognised-extension pattern MORE THAN ONCE is treated as such a
    joined mention and split on "/"; each half is then re-tested on its
    own, and since neither half of a joined mention has a "/" of its own
    any more, both are correctly excluded as bare filenames (see
    _is_path_reference's "/" requirement) rather than checked as paths.

    Skips <...>-wrapped CLI placeholders ("<original.md>" documents a
    parameter shape, not a real file), bare filenames (no "/"), any word
    containing "$" -- a shell variable expansion (e.g. "$ARTICLE_RUN_DIR/
    gates/x.json") names a dynamic, per-run path, not a fixed reference
    this scanner can check for existence -- and any token that IS a
    gates/<name> artifact reference (contains "/gates/" or starts with
    "gates/"), round-4 fix: gate artifacts are per-run generated files
    that never exist as a static path under any of detect_dead_paths's
    four candidate roots, so without this exclusion the same token got
    double-extracted and re-flagged dead here even after
    detect_dead_gates correctly learned to check recent run directories
    for it -- gates/ references are detect_dead_gates's evidence rule
    exclusively, never detect_dead_paths's."""
