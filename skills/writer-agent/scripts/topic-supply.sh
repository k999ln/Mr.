# The loop has watched its outlet for months: exact8, receipts, ledgers, all
# instrumented. Nobody counted the inlet. Measured 2026-07-27 05:40, fifteen
# minutes before a scheduled publish: one card in the runtime queue, which that
# run would consume, and every raw idea already published. The hardest rule in
# this system is that a day is never skipped, and its largest threat turned out
# to be neither a gate nor a judge but an empty shelf.
#
# Read-only by design. It counts and warns; refilling is a separate decision,
# because a malformed card breaks topic selection outright and that failure is
# worse than the shortage it was meant to cure.
#
#   topic-supply.sh [--min N] [--quiet]
