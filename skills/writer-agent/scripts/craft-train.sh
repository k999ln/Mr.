#!/usr/bin/env bash
# craft-train.sh — nightly SkillOpt trainer for skills/writing-craft/CRAFT.md
# (spec 47 19-4c T6, BUILD 3).
#
# Every night, SkillOpt proposes at most two bounded edits to CRAFT.md (the
# vendor adapter's edit_budget=2), and the edits survive only if held-out
# beat rate strictly improves. All decision logic (guard, accept/reject,
# sha256 compare, protected-block safety) lives in craft_train.py so it can
# be driven by fixtures in the contract test with no live model call and no
# live network -- this script's own job is just: export the two
# OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_* env vars SkillOpt's openai_compatible backend needs
# (NEVER echo the key -- without these, SkillOpt silently addresses
# api.openai.com with the key "dummy" and burns every retry on a 401, and a
# launchd job inherits no environment, so this is the difference between
# learning and a quiet no-op every night), then delegate.
#
# Exits 0 whether or not an edit was accepted, and exits 0 on the
# fewer-than-3-scored-runs guard too -- a night that learns nothing is a
# normal night; a nonzero exit would make launchd look broken.
#
# T15 wall-clock follow-up: this script also owns the hard deadline (part
# 3) -- craft_train.py's own projection check (part 4) refuses to START a
# run that would not finish before it, and its subprocess timeout stops
# SkillOpt cleanly at it if a run somehow runs long anyway, but BOTH of
# those live inside the python process this script launches. If that
# process itself hangs outside its own subprocess call (a bug, not the
# expected path), this script's own `timeout` wrapper below is the
# last-resort kill switch that guarantees "regardless of progress" is
# actually true, not just "true unless craft_train.py itself breaks".
