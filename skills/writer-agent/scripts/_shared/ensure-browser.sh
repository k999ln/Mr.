#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ensure-browser.sh — generic CDP-browser watchdog (spec #70b, OSS self-containment).
#
# Bundled, pluggable alternative to the Anicca-instance-specific
# ~/anicca/skills/browser/ensure_browser.sh, which depends on CloakBrowser (a private,
# stealth-focused Chromium fork that is NOT part of this OSS repo) plus three more
# helper scripts (session_vault.py / cdp_context_lease.py / cdp_tab_gc.py) for cookie
# session recovery and idle-tab garbage collection. Those are legitimate needs for a
# heavily-automated daily loop, but they are specific to whatever private browser
# automation stack an installer already runs -- not something this OSS repo can bundle
# without adopting that private tool wholesale. This script does the one thing every
# browser-driving loop actually needs at minimum: confirm something is listening on
# CDP_PORT, launch BROWSER_BIN if not. Write your own session-recovery/tab-gc layer on
# top of this if your loop needs it (see README in this directory).
#
# Env:
#   CDP_PORT      (default 9222)
#   BROWSER_BIN   (path to a Chromium-family binary; required to actually LAUNCH one --
#                  if unset, this script can still detect ALIVE, just not recover)
#   BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR (default ~/.article-loop-browser-profile) -- MUST be a persistent
#     user-data-dir, not a fresh one every run: the publish scripts in this repo assume
#     an already-logged-in session (note/zenn/substack/x/devto cookies), and a blank
#     profile has none. Log in by hand once with this exact profile dir before the loop
#     runs unattended, or point it at a profile #64impl's self-signup bootstrap already
#     created for you.
#
# Usage: bash ensure-browser.sh   -> prints ALIVE (already up) / RECOVERED (relaunched) /
#                                     FAILED (could not confirm a live CDP endpoint)
