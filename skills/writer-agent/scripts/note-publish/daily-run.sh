# F3 — what the staged launchd job runs daily. SAFE BY DESIGN (hardened after VSDD adversary review):
#  - ★ NOTE_FORCE_DRAFT=1 is exported here = a DETERMINISTIC gate: publish.py/toggle-plan.py refuse to click
#    投稿/更新/公開 under normal operation. (Honest scope: a fully-compromised skip-perms agent is
#    out-of-scope per the spec threat model; mitigated by input sanitization + trusted prompt + future
#    container isolation.) The "tap" to allow a manual publish = `publish-to-note.sh enable-publish` + NOTE_MODE=go.
#  - Without NOTE_TOPIC it is a pure no-op (keeps the note channel clean — only the Automaton article).
#  - NOTE_TOPIC is sanitized (allow-list + length cap) before it ever reaches the agent prompt (no injection).
