"""Shared PUBLISH GUARD (VSDD F3 FIND-007/008). Every script that clicks 投稿する/更新する/公開する/申請する
MUST call assert_publish_allowed() immediately before that click, so NO script on disk can push a note article
public unless publishing is EXPLICITLY enabled.

Threat model (honest — see spec FIND-009): this is strong defense-in-depth against ACCIDENTAL publishing and
NORMAL operation. It is NOT an absolute sandbox against a fully-compromised `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
Bash agent (which is omnipotent on the host and could set env + create the sentinel). Those threats are mitigated
elsewhere: NOTE_TOPIC is allow-list sanitized before reaching the agent, the agent runs OUR trusted prompt, and
true isolation (container/VM) is future work. The scheduled/unattended path sets NOTE_FORCE_DRAFT=1 and removes
the sentinel, so under normal operation it can only ever DRAFT.

To ENABLE a (manual, human) publish, BOTH must hold:
  1. env: NOTE_MODE=go  AND  NOTE_FORCE_DRAFT != 1
  2. a fresh sentinel file ~/.cloak/note-work/.PUBLISH_ENABLED (created by `publish-to-note.sh enable-publish`,
     valid 10 min — a deliberate act, stronger than an env var alone).
