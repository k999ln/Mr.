# article-self-fix.sh — TRUE autonomous self-heal launcher for the writer-agent loop (part 2/2 of
# the "render-verify + self-fix" pair, Dais's core ask: the loop must self-heal with no human
# babysitting). Copy+tweak of the proven pattern at ~/anicca/skills/self/self-fix.sh (see
# ~/anicca/skills/self/capafy-loop/capafy-loop-daily.sh STEP0 for that script's real calling
# convention -- this file mirrors its spawn/staleness/fingerprint/CLIProxyAPI-fallback structure
# almost verbatim; only the repo identity, task prompt, and log/state file names changed for this
# loop). When a step in article-daily.sh's pass hits a blocker it cannot fix in-pass (a broken
# publish script, a render-verify FAIL it cannot resolve itself, a selector that broke on a
# platform UI change), it calls THIS to spawn a detached, full-power development agent that diagnoses ->
# edits the correct repo's code -> VERIFIES by a real side-effect -> commits+pushes -> writes a
# result marker. That is the actual self-heal mechanism (never "file an issue and wait").
#
# Usage: article-self-fix.sh "<blocker + concrete fix hint>"
#
# Wiring note (explicitly NOT done by this file, per this task's scope): article-daily.sh's STEP0
# does not yet call this, and render-verify-draft.sh's STEP 6.5 slot does not yet exist -- both are
# authfix's follow-up wiring task after the current flat-restructure round completes. This script
# only needs to work correctly when invoked directly with a blocker string.

TASK="AUTONOMOUS SELF-FIX for the ${LOOP} loop (article-daily.sh / render-verify-draft.sh / the platform publish scripts). You are a full-power development agent with browser (the shared daily-driver CDP, default port 9222), Bash, Edit. NEVER ask a human and NEVER present a menu — a blocker is not stop. BLOCKER + HINT: ${BLOCKER}.
DO, in order:
(1) Reproduce the failure yourself and find the ROOT cause (read the actual code + run it + watch where it breaks) — for a broken publish script this usually means opening the real draft/editor page and looking at what actually happened, not guessing from the error text alone.
(2) Fix the code. If the root cause is a brittle DOM-coordinate/selector script that broke on a UI change, do NOT just re-tune coordinates: rebuild the failing step as two-layer agentic (a thin script opens the page, then YOU look at real screenshots and decide each click/type, looping until the real success signal appears).
(3) VERIFY with a REAL side-effect — re-run render-verify-draft.sh against the actual draft URL and see PASS, or otherwise directly observe the fixed behavior (a draft that now renders cleanly, a publish step that now returns a real URL). A patch that only compiles is NOT done. No dry runs, no fake success, no 'should work'.
(4) COMMIT IN THE CORRECT REPO: for EACH file you changed, cd into its directory, run 'git rev-parse --show-toplevel' and 'git remote -v' to confirm which repo it is, then commit+push THERE. Ground truth: this loop's own code (article-daily.sh, skills/writer-agent/) lives under the Rockstar_ibot repository and its configured remote. Never commit runtime state, credentials, or anything under state/ or .env files.
(5) Write the outcome to ${RESULT} as a single line: 'SUCCESS <utc> <one-line real evidence, e.g. a render-verify PASS or a live draft URL>' or 'FAIL <utc> <why + what is still blocked>'. If the fix resolved a self-heal-request marker, rm it.
If after honest effort the fix is genuinely impossible (e.g. an external platform is down), write FAIL with a precise diagnosis to ${RESULT} — still never ask a human. Report what you fixed + the real evidence at the end."
