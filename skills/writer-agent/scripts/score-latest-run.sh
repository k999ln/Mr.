# The pieces existed but nothing called them: the daily prompt writes
# title-candidates-<lang>.json into a run directory, and beat_rate.py has to
# be handed that file by name. Measured 2026-07-27: no caller anywhere in the
# tree. Without this the loop would keep producing ledgers that nobody scores,
# which looks exactly like working and learns exactly nothing.
#
# Runs after publication, never before: scoring is measurement and must not sit
# between a draft and its destinations (spec 47, the PUBLISH ANYWAY boundary).

# Exit 0 when at least one language scored, 1 when there was nothing to score.
# A judge failure is never fatal here: a night without a measurement is a
