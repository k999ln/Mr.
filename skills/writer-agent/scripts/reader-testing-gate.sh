# as identity-gate.sh/rubric-judge.sh but split across TWO independent judge invocations so the second
# (answering) call never sees the first (question-generation) call's reasoning -- only the article body and
# the plain question list, exactly what a genuine first-time reader would have:
#   (1) STORM-persona question generation -- reads the draft AND the SKILL.md 読者persona3種 framing to
#       imagine 3 distinct first-time readers, then asks: what would each of them actually want answered to
#       understand this piece? 5-10 questions.
#   (2) fresh, context-zero judge -- given ONLY the article text + the question list (no persona reasoning,
#       no spec, no conversation history), answers each question using the article alone. Any question it
#       cannot confidently answer from the article is a blind spot the reader would hit.

# ---- (1) QUESTION GENERATION -- STORM 3-persona (SKILL.md 読者persona3種) ----
# A bounded refinement cycle must test a stable target. When --questions-file is provided,
# generate and persist the set once, then reuse it byte-for-byte on every revised draft.
Q_PROMPT="You are generating a reader-testing question set for a publishable article (spec
docs/loop-engineering/47-writer-loop-quality-and-self-improvement.md, P0-3 copy of
github.com/anthropics/skills doc-coauthoring/ Reader Testing, combined with the STORM
persona_generator.py method: stanford-oval/storm).

Read the article below. Imagine THREE distinct first-time readers who might plausibly pick this
article up (e.g. a total newcomer to the topic, someone deciding whether to actually use/adopt
what the article describes, someone who already knows the basics but wants to be convinced with
real numbers -- the actual three depend on this article's specific topic, do not force these exact
three if the topic implies different ones).

For each persona, ask yourself: what would THIS reader need answered to genuinely understand this
piece and judge whether it was worth their time? Then produce ONE combined list of 5 to 10
concrete questions (not questions about the writing quality itself -- questions about the SUBJECT
MATTER a first-time reader would actually have: what is this thing, why does it matter, what did
it actually do/cost/prove, what is the catch).

Output the FINAL LINE as pure JSON exactly, with no other keys and no commentary after it:
