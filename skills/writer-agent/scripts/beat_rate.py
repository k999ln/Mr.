"""Blind pairwise-score our title candidates against real, high-performing
writing we did not write -- the single number (beat rate) the nightly
trainer is allowed to optimise against.

Why this exists: spec 47 section 19.3. The loop currently judges itself with
its own rubric, which is a closed circle -- it can only get better at
pleasing a judge we wrote (arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798, self-correction without
an external signal degrades rather than improves). harvest_corpus.py (19-2)
gave us opponents we did not write and cannot edit. This script is the other
half: it turns (our candidates, their corpus) into beat_rate = the fraction
of blind head-to-head comparisons our headline wins against real headlines
that really performed.

Two design facts drive every choice below:
  * The judge must be blind. It sees two headlines, A and B, no metrics, no
    source, no hint which is ours -- otherwise the number measures the
    judge's bias, not our writing.
  * The judge has position bias strong enough to flip verdicts
    (arxiv.org/abs/2305.17926). Every pair is asked in BOTH orderings and
    averaged, so a judge that always prefers "A" produces beat_rate 0.5 for
    everyone (no signal), never a fake win streak for whichever side lands
    on A. The `--max-calls 5, judge-always-says-A` case in the contract test
    is that control, made explicit.

Design choices made because the spec left them open (simplest option, noted
here rather than asked about):
  * Opponent pool = top 20% by metric_primary within (lang, slice=="top"),
    with `int(len * 0.2)` truncation and a floor of 1 so a small corpus
    still yields a usable pool.
  * If the pool has fewer rows than the requested opponent count, all of
    the pool is sampled (not an error) -- there is nothing better to do
    with a thin corpus.
  * A candidate with zero non-null pairs (every judge call for it was
    inconclusive or cut off by the budget) gets beat_rate 0.0, matching the
    JSON schema's numeric (never null) contract for that field.
  * The judge call timeout (JUDGE_TIMEOUT_S, 120s) is not specified by the
    coordinator; picked generously since LLM judge calls are slower than
    the corpus harvester's HTTP calls.
  * `report`'s summary line format is not specified; picked one line per
    lang, key=value, terse enough to paste into the nightly Telegram
    message as-is.

Testing seam (documented per the task's "your choice, document it"): every
scoring function that calls the judge accepts an explicit `judge_fn`
parameter (default: the module-level `call_judge`). Tests inject a fake by
PASSING `judge_fn=` explicitly into `score_ledger`/`score_candidate`/
`score_one_pair`, not by monkeypatching the module attribute `call_judge` --
a monkeypatched module global would not retroactively change an
already-bound default parameter value (a classic Python gotcha), so explicit
injection is both the simpler and the correct seam. No live network in
tests; see tests/beat-rate-contract.sh.

Judge process boundary: exactly `scripts/editorial-gate.sh` and
`self_improve_control.py`'s `model_judge` -- `$ARTICLE_MODEL_RUNNER judge
--prompt-file -`, default $HOME/profitable-claude/skills/writer-agent/
runtime/model-runner.sh. No second model path is invented here; the broker
discovery inside that runner is what keeps judging alive outside the agent
sandbox.

CORPUS INPUT: skills/writer-agent/state/writing-corpus/*.jsonl, the
harvest_corpus.py (19-2) schema -- rows carry `lang`, `slice`
("top"|"baseline"), and `metric_primary` (the raw number norm_score was
computed from).

Output: <run-dir>/gates/beat-rate-<lang>.json, schema fixed by the
coordinator's spec (see score_ledger's docstring for the exact keys).
