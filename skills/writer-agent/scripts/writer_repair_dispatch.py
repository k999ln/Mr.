"""Claim exactly one actionable Writer incident per tick and route it.

SSOT §9.0 Order 4: known failure classes go to deterministic runbooks, unknown
ones go to Terra, and Sol is never used for routine repair.

Boundaries this script keeps:

* Exactly one incident is claimed per invocation, under the incident queue's
  own advisory lock, so two overlapping ticks cannot work the same incident.
  The claim carries a lease taken through the queue's state machine.
* A blocking `revenue-set` incident outranks a non-blocking distribution one
  regardless of age: a free-distribution failure must never delay the paid
  shipment.
* A KNOWN route ends at a durable runbook *decision* receipt.  Executing the
  runbook command and resuming the run is Order 5, so no publisher side effect
  is produced here.
* An UNKNOWN route builds the deterministic investigation receipt and then asks
  Terra through the shared runner with `ARTICLE_MODEL_ROLE=terra`. Sol is unreachable:
  `sol-audit` additionally requires an `ARTICLE_SOL_TRIGGER_RECEIPT`, which this
  script never sets and actively removes from the child environment.
* The model call is the only slow step and it runs inside the held publication
  lock, so it is spent only when there is no publication progress to protect:
  either no backlog, or the routed incident itself owns the open circuit that
  is holding its pending destination.  Deferring on backlog alone would let the
  backlog become its own cause.  The deterministic route and all its receipts
  land on every tick regardless.
* Every routed incident produces a repair-attempt receipt.  Values the runtime
  genuinely does not measure (tokens, cost) are recorded as `unknown` with a
  reason; they are never reported as zero.
