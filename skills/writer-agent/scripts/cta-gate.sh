# cta-gate.sh — refuse to ship a piece that gives the reader nowhere to go.
#
# Measured 2026-07-27: the twenty most-read dev.to pieces carried 2,538 of
# 3,314 total views and not one contained a path back to us. Conversion was
# structurally zero, and no amount of writing quality moves a number that is
# multiplied by an absent link. The doors existed only on recent pieces that
# nobody had found yet.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a judge. It counts. A model asked "does this have a
# good call to action" will answer yes about a piece that has none, because it
# is agreeable and the question is fuzzy; grep is not agreeable. Quality gates
# are advisory here (spec 47), but this one is a revenue-path invariant and
# fails closed.
#
#   cta-gate.sh <article.md>
#   exit 0 = a path is present, 1 = none found, 2 = usage
