"""A bounded repair channel that can actually write. SSOT §9.3.1 item H2.

The first completed investigation returned `cause_status UNDETERMINED` with
`complete: true` and asked, in its own `remaining_work`, for note's current
terms, posting policy, and any official specification defining a 422 body
rejection, fetched as 原文 and matched against the failing request before
concluding a violation.  A read-only, offline judge cannot do that.  This module
is the capability, under guardrails copied wholesale from the prior art §9.3.1
already recorded.

That same verdict is also why this module refuses empty handoffs.  It named
zero `primary_sources` and put no URL in `remaining_work`, so `fetch_sources`
-- the only egress here, and one that takes explicit URLs -- would have fetched
nothing, and three bounded attempts would have been spent producing no
evidence-backed change: the "ran but did no work" signature H1 exists to catch.
Two mechanisms close that:

* **resolution without recall.**  `config/repair-source-registry.json` maps a
  destination to documents that were curated *by fetching them*, so `note/ja`
  resolves to note's own binding terms without any model remembering a URL.  A
  recalled URL is not merely unreliable, it is confidently wrong: during
  curation `https://note.com/guideline` returned HTTP 200 and is a user's
  profile page, not note's guideline.  A 200 proves reachability, never
  identity.
* **an empty set is refused before it costs anything.**  `UnresolvableSources
  Error` is raised before the worktree exists and before the plan advances
  `attempts`, so a verdict with nothing to read leaves the bounded budget
  intact for one that has.  The refusal travels the dispatcher's existing
  preparation-failure bound, so it is counted three times and then degrades --
  no second budget was invented for it.

The guardrails, copied wholesale from the prior art §9.3.1 already records:

* **Renovate** gates automerge strictly on green required checks.  Here the only
  status that a downstream stage will accept is `CANDIDATE_VERIFIED`, and it is
  written only when every configured test command exited `0`.  A failing
  candidate is written as `DISCARDED`, which
  `writer_incident_queue.register_candidate` rejects by schema -- so "green is
  the only gate" is enforced by the consumer, not by this module's good manners.
* **SapFix** validates each candidate in an isolated environment against
  existing plus generated tests and degrades to a full or partial revert when
  every candidate fails.  Here each attempt runs in its own git worktree and a
  discarded attempt is hard-reverted to `base_head`.
* **The escalation rule**: bounded attempts, then degrade to the safest known
  state, then stop until a genuinely new trigger.  The trigger is the *same*
  token the investigation path already uses -- occurrence count plus deployed
  commit, from `writer_repair_investigation_session` -- so there is one
  mechanism, not two.

What makes the external-effect prohibitions real rather than instructional:

| Prohibition | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| no publish/post/submit/send | the model runs with `network_access=false`; it has no egress at all.  The only outbound path in this channel is `fetch_sources`, which this module owns and which can issue nothing but an unauthenticated HTTPS `GET` |
| no write outside the workspace | `--sandbox workspace-write` with `/tmp` and `$TMPDIR` excluded, so the worktree is the sole writable root.  Detected as well as prevented: a canary outside the workspace and the source repository's own HEAD and porcelain status are compared before and after |
| no push to a protected branch | this module never runs `git push`, the model has no network, and `assert_unprotected_branch` refuses to operate on a protected branch name |
| no secrets read or emitted | the child environment is built from an allowlist, so no credential variable is handed over; and every changed file plus every fetched document is scanned before a candidate can be verified |

Deploying the candidate, resuming the work item, and the public readback are
Order 5 and are deliberately absent here.  This module ends at a verified
candidate plus its receipt.

REPAIR_PROMPT = """You are the Writer Agent repair worker for one incident.

Incident fingerprint: {fingerprint}

The completed investigation reached this verdict. It is the only cause material
you may rely on; do not re-derive it and do not contradict it without evidence:
{verdict}

Primary documents already fetched for you, by URL, retrieval time and content
hash. They are on disk and readable. `provenance` says where each came from:
`verdict` means the investigation cited it, `registry:<destination>` means it is
a curated official document for this destination, `caller` means it was passed
in explicitly. A row whose `status` is `UNFETCHED` never arrived and is not
evidence; its `reason` says why. If a document you need is not listed, say so in
`remaining_work`; never invent a URL, a quote, or a rule:
{sources}

Your workspace is the isolated checkout at {workspace} on branch {branch}.
It is the only place you can write. You have no network access at all.

Hard boundaries, all enforced outside this prompt by the sandbox and by the
verification that runs after you:
- Edit files only under {allowed_prefix} inside your workspace.
- Do not publish, post, submit, or send anything to any service.
- Do not run git push, git remote, or any deployment command.
- Do not write, echo, or embed credentials, tokens, cookies, or API keys.
- Do not modify anything outside your workspace.

Do this:
1. Read what you need, using the fetched documents as the authority.
2. Make the smallest change that repairs the named failure.
3. Add or update an automated test under {allowed_prefix}tests/ that fails
   before your change and passes after it.
4. Reply with the JSON object the output schema requires. If you could not
   reach a defensible change, set "complete" to false and say exactly what is
   missing in "remaining_work". A candidate you are unsure of is discarded by
   the test gate anyway, so an honest incomplete answer costs nothing.
