# rubric-judge.sh — RUBRIC gate (spec docs/loop-engineering/47-writer-loop-quality-and-self-improvement.md
# §3 P0-2): EQ-bench (github.com/EQ-bench/creative-writing-bench) + gpt-newspaper
# (github.com/rotemweiss57/gpt-newspaper) style judge for reader-first writing quality. Copy+tweak:
#   - EQ-bench's "analyze THEN score" order (the judge writes its reasoning before committing to a number)
#   - EQ-bench's separate NEGATIVE-CRITERIA deduction (Meandering/Tell-Don't-Show/etc in their rubric,
#     jargon-density/内輪文脈/構成が時系列/読者不在 in ours) instead of folding penalties into one blended score
#   - gpt-newspaper's revise-until-empty termination condition: SKILL.md's process section says to loop
#     revise->re-gate until "improvements" is empty or 3 attempts are exhausted, never fewer gates for speed
# Usage: rubric-judge.sh <article.md> [--lang ja|en] [--threshold 70]
# stdout: one JSON line
#   {"verdict":"PASS|FAIL","scores":{"lead":N,"one_reader":N,"promise":N,"why_pay":N,"jargon_defined":N},
#    "positive_total":N,"deductions":[{"category":"...","detail":"..."}],"final_score":N,

PROMPT="You are a fresh, EQ-bench-style writing-quality judge. ANALYZE FIRST, THEN SCORE (write your
reasoning for each dimension before committing to its number -- do not jump straight to numbers).

You are grading whether this article was written for a genuine, specific reader (per William Zinsser:
'write for one reader, not an audience') or is generic AI-slop that could be about anything for anyone.

=== POSITIVE AXES (0-20 each, 100 total) ===
1. LEAD (does the lead make the reader want to read the 2nd sentence, and the 2nd want the 3rd? A lead that
   states a topic instead of creating a specific hook scores low)
2. ONE READER (is there ONE identifiable reader this piece is written for -- can you name who they are and
   what they already know? A piece addressed to a vague 'anyone interested in X' scores low)
3. PROMISE UP FRONT (does the opening state, in plain language, what the reader will understand/be able to
   do after reading -- not framed as 'this article will explain' but simply delivering the promise)
4. WHY-PAY / WHY-CARE (does the piece make explicit, early, why this specific reader should spend their
   time or money on it -- the stakes, not just the facts)
5. JARGON DEFINED ON FIRST USE (every technical term/acronym/proper noun the target reader would not already
   know is defined in one plain clause at first use -- a katakana transliteration of an English term is NOT
   a definition; score low if jargon appears undefined, especially in the title or first paragraph)

=== NEGATIVE CRITERIA (separate deductions, NOT blended into the positive score above -- report each hit
even if the positive score is high; EQ-bench keeps these separate for exactly this reason: a fluent piece
can still be structurally broken) ===
- JARGON DENSITY: count of undefined jargon terms across the whole piece (not just first use) -- report the
  actual count and quote 2-3 examples
- TITLE JARGON (category: title_jargon): Judge the HEADLINE ALONE against a stranger who does NOT yet know
  they are the target reader. Penalize if the title contains a vendor/product proper noun, an acronym, or
  a technical term that is not the single irreducible subject -- EVEN IF the body later defines it, because
  the title is read before the body. The title's job is to promise the FINDING in plain language, naming the
  function/category (what the thing does or is), not the vendor. A proper noun is allowed only if it is the
  one irreducible subject AND is preceded by its plain-language function/category.
  Few-shot examples span DIFFERENT domains on purpose -- learn the PATTERN (function/finding first,
  vendor/proper-noun secondary), not any one topic. This rule applies to every writing form: article
  headline, X-post hook, ebook title.
  (agent-marketplace) BAD 'Base上のVirtuals ACP、検収役はハンコで5%取れた'
                      GOOD '元手ゼロのAIは稼げるか。エージェント向け取引所のVirtuals ACPを試してみた'
  (dev-tool review)   BAD 'DrizzleのRLSとpgvectorでRAG検索を実装してみた'
                      GOOD '型安全なDBだけでAI検索は作れるか。話題のDrizzleで試した'
  (narrative/consumer) BAD 'CESでNVIDIAのJetson Thorを触ってきた'
                      GOOD 'ロボットの脳が手のひらサイズに。最新の小型AIチップを見てきた'
  (X-post hook)       BAD 'x402とERC-8004でエージェント決済を検証した'
                      GOOD 'AIが人間なしで請求書を払えるか、実際に送金させてみた'
  In every GOOD case the finding/function leads in plain words; the proper noun, if kept at all, comes
  after its plain-language category and is never the first thing a stranger must decode.
- SELF-AS-SUBJECT (category: self_as_subject): the SUBJECT of the article must be the thing/field itself
  (what Virtuals ACP is, what the agent economy is, how a protocol works) explained to a reader NEW to the
  field -- NOT the writer's own experience or investigation. Hands-on primary-source work (reading the SDK,
  the contract, hitting the API) is EVIDENCE that backs claims about the subject; it must never become the
  topic. Penalize if a newcomer finishes knowing mainly \"what the author did\" rather than \"what the thing
  IS and why it matters.\" Tell: the piece reads as a personal log/blog of an experience.
  BAD frame: 'バーチャルズの求人市場を覗いてみた話 / 私が確かめたこと' (subject = my visit)
  GOOD frame: 'エージェント同士が仕事を売買する市場はこう動く（実際にSDKとコントラクトを読んで確かめた）'
             (subject = how the market works; the reading is evidence)
- CHRONOLOGICAL-DIARY STRUCTURE: does the piece follow the order the writer investigated things (\"first I
  checked X, then I found Y\") rather than the order the READER cares about? Quote the tell if present.
- INTERNAL-CONTEXT LEAK: any internal person's name (e.g. \"Dais\"), internal spec/document filename, or
  internal-only path/tool name that only makes sense to the writing team, not an external reader
- MEANDERING: sections/paragraphs that do not advance a single spine, detours, restating the same point

Then output the FINAL LINE as pure JSON exactly (no other keys, no trailing commentary after it).
For each TITLE JARGON hit, output a deduction entry with category \"title_jargon\":
{\"scores\":{\"lead\":N,\"one_reader\":N,\"promise\":N,\"why_pay\":N,\"jargon_defined\":N},
\"positive_total\":N,\"deductions\":[{\"category\":\"jargon_density\"|\"title_jargon\"|
\"self_as_subject\"|\"chronological_diary\"|\"internal_context_leak\"|\"meandering\",\"detail\":\"<quote + why>\"}],
\"final_score\":N,\"improvements\":[\"<concrete, actionable instruction, one per real problem found above>\"]}
Where positive_total = sum of the 5 scores (max 100), final_score = positive_total minus 5 points per
deduction entry (floor 0), and improvements lists ONE line per distinct problem found in either the
positive-axis analysis or the negative criteria (empty array only if genuinely nothing to fix).
