# craft-train-notify.sh — one Telegram line per night about the craft trainer.
#
# Reads the last row of state/craft-train.jsonl and reports what the trainer
# did. Kept separate from craft-train.sh on purpose: a notifier that lives
# inside the trainer can take the trainer down with it, and the one message
# that matters most is the one about a night that went wrong.
#
# Reports three shapes, because they mean different things and collapsing them
# would hide the interesting one:
#   guard    - refused to train (not enough scored runs). A normal early night.
#   reject   - proposed edits, held-out did not improve, craft file unchanged.
#   accept   - edits kept, with the beat rate before and after.
# A run that changed CRAFT.md without improving the score would be a bug, so
# the sha256 pair is always included: it is the only field that cannot lie
# about whether the file moved.
