# article-healthcheck.sh — 5-min launchd poller (spec #22 self-heal L2).
#
# Detects "the daily article pass did not start" or "it started but never finished" faster
# than a human would notice, and alerts by Telegram. That is the WHOLE job -- see the design
# note (task #22 report, 2026-07-16) for why the other three observed failure classes
# (Substack/X session expiry, zenn slug) are deliberately NOT re-checked here: they are
# already detected once per day by article-daily.sh's own pass (STEP 6-9), and the real
# blocker for those is a human re-login (2FA), which polling every 5 minutes cannot fix --
# "monitoring only belongs on what someone can act on; high-frequency re-checking of a fact
# nobody can change is anxiety, not monitoring."
#
# Deliberately does NOT touch the shared daily-driver browser -- ensure_browser.sh already
# runs once per day, inside article-daily.sh's own lock, right before that pass needs it;
# touching the browser here too, every 5 minutes, independent of that lock, would race it.
#
# Deliberately does NOT source or exec any part of article-daily.sh. Running fragments of
# that script (to read a variable, etc.) re-triggers its own `echo ... >>"$LOG"` startup line
# with no corresponding pass -- this is what produced three phantom "run" log entries with no
# "done" on 2026-07-16 07:08 (confirmed root cause: team-lead sourcing script fragments to
# extract PROMPT for inspection). This script only ever READS the log as plain text.
