# tunnel-watcher.sh — self-heal the sutando phone server when the cloudflared
# quick tunnel rotates its URL.
#
# Problem: cloudflared quick tunnel gets a NEW https://*.trycloudflare.com URL
# every time the tunnel daemon restarts (crash / network blip / launchd respawn).
# sutando reads the tunnel URL ONCE at startup (TWILIO_WEBHOOK_URL). When the URL
# rotates, sutando keeps using the dead old URL → Twilio TwiML callback fails →
# caller hears "application error, goodbye".
#
# Fix: every 30s, compare the live tunnel URL (anicca_phone_url.txt, written by
# tunnel.sh) against the URL sutando is actually serving (/health webhookUrl).
# If they differ, restart sutando so it re-reads the current URL.
#
# Permanent alternative (not done): cloudflared NAMED tunnel with a fixed
# hostname (phone.aniccaai.com) — needs Cloudflare account + DNS. This watcher
# avoids that setup and self-heals the quick tunnel.
