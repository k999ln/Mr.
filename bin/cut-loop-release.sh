# cut-loop-release.sh — turn a commit into an immutable release that launchd can point at.
#
#   bash bin/cut-loop-release.sh [<ref>]        # default: HEAD
#
# Why this exists: 221 of the 241 launchd agents on this machine run their code straight out of a
# git working tree (measured 2026-08-17 via bin/launchd_inventory.py). A working tree follows
# whoever is working in it, so a branch switch deletes a scheduled job's code out from under it --
# which is exactly what happened to the x-repost loop that day.
#
# The shape is the one this house already uses for the gig lanes (~/gig/releases/<repo>/<sha>/) and
# the one Capistrano documents: releases accumulate under their own id, a single `current` symlink
# selects one, and rollback is moving that symlink back. 12-factor V puts it plainly -- "it is
# impossible to make changes to the code at runtime" -- which a chmod -R a-w export enforces
# literally rather than by convention.
#
# State is deliberately NOT inside a release: see LOOPS_STATE_ROOT below.
